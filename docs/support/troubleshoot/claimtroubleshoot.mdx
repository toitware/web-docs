## Problems with claiming your device

<Expandable title="Did you setup your ESP32 with Toit firmware, but claiming failed?">

<Tabs>
<Tab label="YES">

If your device was provisioned with the Toit firmware and WiFi settings, but the automatic claiming step failed, try the following:

- First, get the hardware ID from the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial), or use the Toit CLI to get the hardware ID by executing the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit serial info -o yaml
```

- Next, manually claim your device using the Toit CLI, by executing the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit device claim hardware-id
```

where you replace `hardware-id` with the actual hardware ID of your device. For example:

```shell
toit device claim 384a9843-cdb8-4dc6-970a-030fb8148068
```

- If the manual claiming succeeds, your device will be visible in the [list of devices](https://console.toit.io/devices) in the Toit console.

- You can also claim your device manually from the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial) by clicking the Claim button and paste the hardware ID.

## Problems with connecting to WiFi before claiming?

<Expandable title="Are you unsure whether your device can get online, before you manually claim the device?">

<Tabs>
<Tab label="YES">

- Press the `Monitor` button in the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial) in the Toit console, to see whether the device is trying to connect to the Toit cloud with the WiFi credentials provided.

- Or use the Toit CLI to get the serial debug output:

```shell
toit serial monitor
```

- If the device fails or succeeds connecting via WiFi, you can see the status in the serial monitor output.

- If connection via WiFi fails, you must reinstall the Toit firmware and WiFi settings in order to get your device online. Use the `Reinstall` button on the Web serial page.

- Afterwards, use the `Monitor` option again to make sure your device can get online. When it does, click the `Claim` button in the Serial view, in order to claim the device into your Toit project.
