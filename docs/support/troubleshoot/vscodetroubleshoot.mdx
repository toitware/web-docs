**Error: "Couldn't start client Language Server"**

Make sure `jag` is in your path. When you [install](../../getstarted/device) the Jaguar executable
check the "Add the Jaguar CLI application directory to the PATH variable" box when running the installer.

Restart VS Code (reloading the window is not enough).

To verify that `jag` is found in VS Code, open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`) and run

```shell
jag
```

The result should be a list of all available commands in the Jaguar CLI.

**Error: "The Language Server is not responding. Consult the documentation"**

When prompted by Windows Defender, allow the LSP client access to the network.

**Still not working?**
