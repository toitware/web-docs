# Firmware flashing

## Problems flashing your ESP32

<Expandable title="Problems with installing the firmware on your ESP32?">

- Some hardware models need physical interaction with the device during initial provisioning - like pushing a button.

- If flashing doesn't work, consult the documentation for your ESP32 chip.

- If you have timeout problems when flashing, some hardware models require you to [hold down BOOT button](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/).
  Read more info about the bootloader mode [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/advanced-topics/boot-mode-selection.html).

- If the flashing fails, consider trying with a lower baud rate (here half the default baud rate):

```shell
jag flash --baud 460800 --wifi-ssid="MY_SSID" --wifi-password="MY_PASSWORD"
```
