- Some hardware models need physical interaction with the device during initial provisioning - like pushing a button.

- If flashing doesn't work, consult the documentation for your ESP32 chip.

- If you have timeout problems when flashing, some hardware models require you to [hold down BOOT button](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/).
  Read more info about the bootloader mode [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/advanced-topics/boot-mode-selection.html).

- If the flashing fails, consider trying with a lower baud rate (here half the default baud rate):

```shell
jag flash --baud 460800 --wifi-ssid="MY_SSID" --wifi-password="MY_PASSWORD"
```

If Jaguar cannot find your device after having flashed it, you may be running into a network issue. Check that you development
machine is on the same network as the device and that no firewall is preventing the communications.
You can help Jaguar to find your device by giving it the device's IP address
(which is printed at boot time). For example:
``` shell
jag scan 192.168.1.42
```

If you cannot solve or diagnose the issue, please reach out to the Toit engineering team through our [Discord chat](https://chat.toit.io).
