If you are using macOS or Windows, you might need to install or update the following USB driver on your computer:

- The USB to UART Bridge VCP driver from [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

For Windows, install the CP210x Universal Windows Driver.
For macOS, install the CP210x VCP Mac OSX Driver.

Install the driver, _reboot your computer_ and you are ready to talk to your ESP32 via a serial port.

## Problems with the serial port

<Expandable title="Do you have problems with detecting a serial port on your computer?">

The Jaguar CLI offers commands to help you connect your ESP32 via a serial connection.

Start by connecting your ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer.

List the serial ports currently in use on your computer by running the following command with the Jaguar CLI in a terminal window:

``` sh
jag port --list
```

For example, if exactly one serial port, called `COM3`, is currently in use, the output of the command will look like this

``` txt
$ jag port --list
COM3
```

You can monitor the serial output of the ESP32 with the command:

``` sh
jag monitor
```

The monitoring can be stopped by `Ctrl+C`.
