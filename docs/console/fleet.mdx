# Device fleet

You can organize your devices by renaming them so they share an identical prefix.

For example, devices `Toitbox1`, `Toitbox2` and `Toitbox3` are seen as a fleet of devices in the Toit CLI by using the prefix `-p toitbox` in the `toit fleet` commands. Prefixes are case-insensitive.

Update the firmware on several devices in one command with the Toit CLI command:

```
toit fleet -p <prefix> update
```

Deploy a Toit app on several devices in one command:

```
toit fleet -p <prefix> deploy job.yaml
```

or deploy two Toit apps in one command with:

```
toit fleet -p <prefix> deploy job1.yaml job2.yaml
```
