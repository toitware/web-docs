# Organize devices into a fleet of devices

You can organize your devices by renaming them so they share an identical prefix.

For example, devices `Toitbox1`, `Toitbox2` and `Toitbox3` are seen as a fleet of devices in the Toit CLI by using the prefix `-p toitbox` in the `toit fleet` command. Prefixes are case-insensitive.

Update the firmware on several devices in one command, use the Toit CLI command:

```
toit fleet -p <prefix> update
```

or to deploy one or more apps on several devices at once, use the CLI command:

```
toit fleet -p <prefix> deploy
```
