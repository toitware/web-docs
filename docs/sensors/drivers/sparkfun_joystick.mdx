# Write a driver

We are using the [SparkFun Qwiic Joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) as an example of how to write a driver for a sensor. The SparkFun Qwiic Joystick is a 2-axis joystick with a single button. Using a qwiic connector, it's very simple to get the joystick connected.

This guide will walk through the steps of identifying how the sensor communicates and how to write a fully working driver for it.

## Approach

The Joystick features a ATtiny85 microcontroller with a custom firmware. As described in the [Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide), the firmware exposes several registers. With that in mind, we're going to do the following steps:

1. Connect the Joystick to an I2C bus, configuring the I2C device.
2. Use the `Registers` abstraction to communicate with the chip.
3. Validate connectivity to the device.
4. Read out Axis and Button values.

## I2C setup

We use a simple I2C setup, currently using pin `21` for `SDA` (blue) and pin `22` for `SCL` (yellow).

```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c

main:
bus := i2c.Bus
--sda=gpio.Pin 21
--scl=gpio.Pin 22

```

## Driver skeleton

As all I2C/SPI drivers that work using registers, the driver starts with the following skeleton.

```

import serial

class SparkFunJoystick:
static I2C_ADDRESS ::= 0x20

registers\_/serial.Registers

constructor device/serial.Device:
registers\_ = device.registers

on:

off:

```

Note the address, as described in the hookup guide.

### Validate connectivity

The hookup guide has a table of I2C registers available in the custom firmware. At address `0x00` is the slave address assigned to the device (hardcoded to `0x20`). By reading this register, we can confirm the connectivity to the device is functional.

```

class SparkFunJoystick:
static REG*DEFAULT_ADDRESS* ::= 0x00

[...]

on:
reg := registers*.read_u8 REG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS*
if reg != I2C_ADDRESS: throw "INVALID_CHIP"

```

With this added, we can validate the setup:

```

main:

[...]

device := bus.device SparkFunJoystick.I2C_ADDRESS

joystick := SparkFunJoystick device

joystick.on
print "SparkFunJoystick"

```

Running the code should print out the string `SparkFunJoystick` to the terminal. If not, the I2C bus is not configured to match the wiring.

<Note>
  If the Joystick is connected without the full breakout board from SparkFun, I2C pull-up resistors may be needed.
</Note>

### Read out data

We're going to expand the driver with 3 new methods:

```

class SparkFunJoystick:

[...]

/\*_
Returns the horizontal value in the range [-1..1].
_/
horizontal -> float:

/\*_
Returns the vertical value in the range [-1..1].
_/
vertical -> float:

/\*_
Returns true if the button is pressed.
_/
pressed -> bool:

```

Both the horizontal and vertical value is formatted the same way; 2 bytes in big endian order (MSB first). We want to transform this value to a float in the range [-1..1]. Let's create a helper function to perform this step:

<Note>
  The last 6 bits of the result are unused, but to keep the code simple we treat the result as an 16-bit unsigned
  integer.
</Note>

```

import binary

class SparkFunJoystick:

[...]

read*position* reg/int -> float:
value := registers\_.read_u16_be reg
// Move from uint16 range to int16 range.
value -= binary.INT16_MAX
// Perform floating-point division to get to [-1..1] range.
return value.to_float / binary.INT16_MAX

```

With that in place, we can now finish the `horizontal` and `vertical` methods:

```

class SparkFunJoystick:
static REG*HORIZONTAL_POSITION*::= 0x03 // (to 0x04)
static REG*VERTICAL_POSITION* ::= 0x05 // (to 0x06)

[...]

horizontal -> float:
return read*position* REG*HORIZONTAL_POSITION*

vertical -> float:
return read*position* REG*VERTICAL_POSITION*

```

Lastly, we need to implement the `pressed` method. We're simply going to read out the 1-byte register value and check for `0`, with `0` meaning pressed.

```

class SparkFunJoystick:
static REG*BUTTON_POSITION* ::= 0x07

[...]

pressed -> bool:
return (registers*.read_u REG_BUTTON_POSITION*) == 0

```

Let's try it out:

```

main:

[...]

joystick.on
while true:
print "$joystick.horizontal - $joystick.vertical (pressed: $joystick.pressed)"
sleep --ms=250

```

This code will run until aborted (Ctrl-C).

<Note>
  As the joystick is moved around, it's possible to get an I2C error if the I2C bus is accidentally short-circuited by
  the fingers.
</Note>

<Note>
  To improve responsibility, the sensor should be read at a higher frequency. However no printing should be done at
  higher frequencies to avoid logging data building up.
</Note>
