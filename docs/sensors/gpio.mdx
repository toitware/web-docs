# Work with GPIO Pins

The ESP32 has 34 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that can be easily configured and manipulated at runtime.

In Toit, the GPIO pins are exposed in the [gpio.toit module](https://libs.toit.io/lib.gpio/gpio.toit).

## Output

In output-mode, the GPIO pin can be used to turn an LED on/off for example. The following schematic shows how a simple LED could be connected.

To create a GPIO Pin on `pin 21` in output mode, use `Pin`:

```
import gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 21
```

The pin is `low (0)` by default, so to set it `high (1)` use `Pin.set`.

```
import gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 21
  pin.set 1
  sleep --ms=1000
```

This will keep the light turned on for 1000ms.

<Note type="warning">
When the program terminates, the pin will automatically be reset thus turning off the LED.
</Note>

## Adding sensors

Sensors and minimal capacitors are available as break out boards.
They can be connected to an ESP32 using soldering on pin or using a cable system such as the Qwiic system.

All Qwiic cables have the following color scheme and arrangement:

* Black = GND - to be connected to the GND ground pin of the ESP32

* Red = 3.3V - to be connected to the 3.3V power pin of the ESP32

* Blue = SDA - data channel to be connected to any numbered pin of the ESP32

* Yellow = SCL - clock line to be connected to any numbered pin of the ESP32. It is used to synchronize all data transfers over the I2C bus. 

When more than one sensor / actuator is needed, you can use a breadboard to allow for multiple connections. It is also sometimes possible to connect several sensors one after the other with Qwiic cables.

The drivers I2C, SPI and Pulse Width Modulation are available for use with the sensors, actuators and other peripherals.
