# Add sensors

We are using the [BOSCH BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/) as an example of how to add a sensor to your ESP32.
The BOSCH BME280 chip is an environment sensor measuring temperature, humidity and pressure.

## Setup

The sensor supports both I2C and SPI connection mode. This guide will focus on the Sparkfun BME280 breakout board connected using a qwiic cable.

<Note>
If you connect a different BME280 sensor breakout board, you may have to place additional pull-up resistors on the I2C wires.
</Note>

Connect the qwiic cable to the BME280 breakout board and connect the `red` wire to 3.3V (`3V3`) and the `black` wire to ground.

The remaining two wires are I2C SDA (`blue`) and I2C SCL (`yellow`). While any GPIO pin of the ESP32 can facilitate an I2C setup we're going to pick _pin 21 and 22_ respectively through this guide.

## Code

First we're going to set up the I2C bus so we can connect the device:

<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22
```

With the bus configured, we can specify how to address the BME280 device on the bus. From the Sparkfun BME280 breakout documentation we can see that the default configured address is `0x77`:

```
  device := bus.device 0x77
```

The device returned is of type `serial.Device`.

With the device configured we can take a look at the driver.
The driver is available at `drivers.bme280` and as all other [drivers](https://libs.toit.io/drivers), takes a `serial.Device` as argument - perfect!

<!-- SKIP CODE -->
```
import drivers.bme280

// ...

bme := drivers.Bme280 device
```

<Note>
Configuring and SPI Bus and Device will also provide a `serial.Device`. The driver thus works seamlessly between I2C and SPI setups.
</Note>

The driver will take care of all the communication with the BME280 sensor and provides a high-level API for reading out the relevant data:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->
```
  bme.on
  print "Temperature: $bme.read_temperature C"
  print "Humidity: $bme.read_humidity %"
  print "Pressure: $bme.read_pressure Pa"
  bme.off
```

That will print out something along the lines of

```txt
$ toit run -d demo-device bme280.toit
2021-01-20T09:30:07.678192Z: <process initiated>
Temperature: 22.350000000000001421 C
Humidity: 45.2626953125 %
Pressure: 98641.3359375 Pa
2021-01-20T09:30:07.858870Z: <process terminated - exit code: 0>
```

## Full example

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c
import drivers.bme280

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22

  device := bus.device 0x77

  bme := drivers.Bme280 device

  bme.on
  print "Temperature: $bme.read_temperature C"
  print "Humidity: $bme.read_humidity %"
  print "Pressure: $bme.read_pressure Pa"
  bme.off
```
