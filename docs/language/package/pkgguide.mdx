# Package quick start

This section provides instructions on how to use the Toit package manager (henceforth TPM) for common operations. See [Packages](../../package) for the full documentation.

## Installing a package

You might need to add a registry as the first thing, before you can proceed with installing a package (see below "Adding a Registry").

The following CLI commands update the local registry, search for a package, and then install it.

```shell
toit pkg sync          # Synchronize the installed registries.
toit pkg search morse  # Search for a package "morse".
toit pkg install morse # Install package "morse".
```

<Note title="Unique names">

The installation of "morse" only works if the name is unambiguous. If there are multiple "morse" packages, then one has to use the URL. It is possible to omit leading segments if that makes the package unique:

```shell
toit pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-morse
toit pkg install toitware/toit-morse  # Probably already unique.
```

</Note>

## Adding a Registry

Before being able to install any package, one must have a registry installed. Newer versions of the `toit` CLI do this automatically, but it never hurts to check:

See which registries are installed:

```shell
toit pkg registry list
```

You should have one or more registries:

```txt
toit: github.com/toitware/registry (git)
```

If not, add a registry; for example the Toit registry:

```shell
toit pkg registry add toit github.com/toitware/registry
```

## Creating a Package

Create a new Git repository (for example `github.com/toitware/toit-morse`).

Add or move code into the `src` folder of the new repository.

Optionally (but strongly recommended) add a LICENSE file. We recommend a [permissive free software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_software_license), such as MIT.

Optionally (but strongly recommended) add a README.md. The title should be the package-name. The first paragraph should start as if prefixed with "This is a package containing". The first paragraph should have meaning on its own.

Optionally (but recommended) add a CHANGELOG.md.

Optional (but strongly recommended): polish the package, with an eye on

- [toitdocs](../../sdk/toitdoc),
- types,
- examples, and
- tests

Create a `package.yaml` in the root of the repository, with the following entries:

- `name`: The name of the package. Don't add this entry if the README's title is the package-name.

- `description`: A short description of the package. Don't add this entry if the README's first paragraph is a good description.

- `license`: The license of the package. Don't add this entry if there is a LICENSE file. The license file or entry should follow [github conventions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository).

- `dependencies`: a map of dependencies. Each entry should look as follows:
  ```
    prefix:
      url: <PKG_URL>
      version: <VERSION_CONSTRAINT, such as ^1.0.0>
  ```

Commit everything and tag it with the version number of the package. If you think that the package should be used by other developers, consider giving it a `v1.0.0` version number. (There is nothing gained by calling it `v0.0.1`).

Version numbers must be prefixed with `v` and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Push your changes to the public repository (if not yet done), and inform a registry of its existence.

For the Toit package registry, publish your new package [here](https://pkg.toit.io/publish). Your package will be validated by the Toit team, before it can be available for the rest of the
Toit community. The validation is performed solely to avoid having packages that could be potentially harmful.
