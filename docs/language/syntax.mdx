# Syntax fundamentals

This document describes the basics of the Toit language. To learn about Toit's
documentation convention, see the language [documentation
convention](../../sdk/toitdoc) section.

## Whitespace and indentation

Toit uses whitespace and indentation to construct the code structure:
comment. For example:

```
// Defines globals first, and then uses main function to
// print out something.
i := 1
j := 10

main:
  while i < j:
    print i
    i = i + 1
```

## Declaration and assignment

In the above, we declared new variables `i` and `j` using
colon-equals. We assigned a new value to the existing variable,
`i`, using a single equals sign. To declare a variable without
giving it a value, you can use a question mark: `:= ?`.

```
  x := 0
  if (random 2) == 0:
    x = 42

  y := ?
  if (random 2) == 0:
    y = 1
  else:
    y = 42

```

The compiler will check that the new variable is assigned a value before it is
used.

## Comments

In Toit, a single line comment begins with a double slash `//` followed by the comment. For example:

```
// This is a single line comment in Toit.
```

For multi-line comments, use `*/`.

```
/*
some multi-line
comment
*/

```

## Identifiers and keywords

Identifiers are names that identify globals, locals, functions, classes, libraries, and other objects in Toit.

- Identifier names can contain only letters, numbers, dashes (-) and underscores (\_), but cannot contain
  spaces. Dashes must be enclosed by letters or numbers. Dashes are equated with underscores. That is,
  `foo-bar` and `foo_bar` refere to the same entity. When possible, prefer dashes.
- Identifiers need to start with a letter or an underscore (\_), but not with a number. The following characters can be alphanumeric or underscore.
- Toit identifiers are case-sensitive.
- Identifier names cannot be the same as keywords and built-in functions in Toit.

The following Toit keywords cannot be used for naming identifiers:

```txt
as          abstract       assert
break       class          continue
else        false          finally
for         if             import
export      null           return
static      true           try
while       or     and     not
```

In addition to these keywords, there are some "pseudo keywords" - like
`constructor` - that cannot be used in certain contexts. Trying these
pseudo-keywords as globals name will generally give an error message in the
IDE.

Another example of pseudo-keyword is `operator` that is allowed as a local but
cannot be the name of a function. Similarly, `string` can be used like a normal
global but would shadow the `string` type.

## String and character literals

Single quotes for are used for character literals and are equivalent to
integer literals of the corresponding Unicode code point, or
rune.

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->

```
  print 'A' // Prints "65", the ASCII code of 'A'.
  print '*' // Prints "42", the ASCII code of '*'.
  print 'æ' // Prints "230", the Unicode code point of 'æ'
  print '€' // Prints "8364", the Unicode code point of the Euro symbol.
  a /int := 'a'  // a now contains the integer 97.
```

Toit uses only double quotes `"` to denote a string literal:

```
  print "Hello, World!"
  str := "a string"  // str has type string.
```

If a string contains a double quote, a backslash, or a dollar sign,
you must use the backslash `\` to
[escape](../strings#escaped-characters) it. The backslash
can also be used for characters that are [difficult to
type](../strings#escaped-characters)
For example:

```
message := "This is a \"valid\" string"
```

The unescaped operator `$` is used for [string
interpolation](../strings#string-interpolation).

The methods available on string objects are documented in
the [string class](https://libs.toit.io/core/class-string).
See also the [guide to Toit strings](../strings).

## Toit globals and constants

The `:=` operator introduces a new global variable with the name of the given identifier (here "global-name").

```
global-name := 103
```

If the global is final (that is, can't be assigned to), then you can use `::=` as in:

```
global-number ::= 42
```

Note that this in this case, `global-number` is actually a constant, and should thus be written in capital characters:

```
GLOBAL-NUMBER ::= 42
```

A final global that isn't a constant could be something that is mutable itself, such as

```
some-global ::= []
```

In this case the global is initialized with an empty list. The content of the
list can change, but it will always be the same list.

When you name a global, you should adhere to rules defined earlier about
[identifiers](../syntax#identifiers-and-keywords).

Global variables (and [static class
variables](../definitions)) are initialized when
they are first used. This is noticeable if their value is
determined by some function call, for example `Time.now`

```
TIME ::= Time.now  // Time.now is called on first use of TIME.

main:
  print "time: $Time.now"  // Print time at program start.
  sleep --ms=2000          // Sleep for two seconds.
  print "TIME: $TIME"      // Print the global constant.
  sleep  --ms=100
  print "TIME: $TIME"      // The global constant remains unchanged.
```

This program will print two different times, the second one twice.

## Indexing syntax

Indexing into lists, maps, byte arrays, and strings can be
done with square brackets, `[]`. The first element has an
index of zero.

For example, an ASCII string is a sequence of characters,
and you can access its elements using square
brackets [] and indexes.

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
str := "Toit String"
byte-array := #[1, 42, 103]
list := [1, 10, 100, 1000]
map := {
  "foo": 42,
  "bar": 103,
}

main:
  print str[0]         // Prints "84", the ASCII code of 'T'.
  print byte-array[1]  // Prints "42", the byte at position 1.
  print list[3]        // Prints "1000", the integer at position 3.
  print map["foo"]     // Prints "42", the value with the key "foo".
```

Indexing into strings is done by [UTF-8 byte
offset](../strings#string-representation), so the
story is a little more complex for non-ASCII strings.

Toit also has support for slices. These are views into part
of a list, byte array, or string:

```
  print str[0..4] // Prints "Toit", the first 4 bytes of "Toit String".
  print str[..4]  // Prints "Toit", the first 4 bytes of "Toit String".
  print str[5..]  // Prints "String", the last part of "Toit String".
```

See also the [description of slice
syntax](../strings#slices-of-strings) in the string
guide.

A slice may keep the underlying object alive, preventing a
garbage collection. To avoid that you can use `copy` to
create a new object containing only the elements in the
slice:

```
long-lived-global/ByteArray := #[]

main:
  huge := ByteArray 1000000
  // The slice keeps huge alive:
  long-lived-global = huge[1000..1050]
  // Makes a copy, so huge can be garbage collected:
  long-lived-global = long-lived-global.copy
```

## Continuation of statements

Toit uses a newline character to separate statements. It places each statement on one line.
However you can break very long statements into multiple lines.

### Line breaks in function arguments

In a long list of arguments for a function call you
can use a new line for each argument.

A long statement can also span multiple lines by using the backslash (\) character.

The following example illustrates how to use per-argument
newlines, or the backslash (\) character to continue a
statement in the second line:

```
// A method with many parameters.
foo a b c d e f g h i j: ...

main:
  some-long-local1 := 1
  some-long-local2 := 2
  some-long-local3 := 3
  some-long-local4 := 4
  some-long-local5 := 5
  some-long-local6 := 6
  some-long-local7 := 7
  some-long-local8 := 8
  some-long-local9 := 9
  some-long-local10 := 10
  // Once there is a newline, all further arguments must be
  // on their own line:
  foo some-long-local1 some-long-local2 some-long-local3
    some-long-local4
    some-long-local5
    some-long-local6
    some-long-local7
    some-long-local8
    some-long-local9
    some-long-local10
  // We can also write all of them in one line:
  foo some-long-local1 some-long-local2 some-long-local3 some-long-local4 some-long-local5 some-long-local6 some-long-local7 some-long-local8 some-long-local9 some-long-local10
  // But that becomes hard to read fast.
  // If we want to cut the line at some point we need a `\` to conceptually continue the first line:
  foo some-long-local1 some-long-local2 some-long-local3 \
      some-long-local4 some-long-local5 some-long-local6 \
      some-long-local7 some-long-local8 some-long-local9 \
      some-long-local10
```

Putting a line break between function arguments also has the effect
of grouping the arguments, which can make parentheses
unneccessary:

```
two-arg-function a b:
  return a + b

three-arg-function a b c:
  return a + b + c

my-func a/int b/int c/int -> int:
  // Long line with many parentheses.
  x := three-arg-function (two-arg-function a b) (two-arg-function b c) (two-arg-function c a)

  // One line per argument looks better:
  y := three-arg-function
    (two-arg-function a b)
    (two-arg-function b c)
    (two-arg-function c a)

  // For a cleaner look we don't need parentheses around
  // the arguments that have their own line.
  z := three-arg-function
    two-arg-function a b
    two-arg-function b c
    two-arg-function c a

  return x + y + z
```

### Line breaks in operator expressions

If you need to break up a large expression, the second and subsequent
lines should be indented more than the first:

```
long-expr-function long-argument-name other-argument-name:
  return long-argument-name
    + 2 * other-argument-name
    - long-argument-name.abs
```

As seen here, the preferred style is to put binary operators after
the line break, not before.

### Line breaks in multi-line or very long string literals

See the
[guide to strings](../strings) on how to format
[multi-line strings](../strings#multi-line-strings) and how to line-break
[very long string literals](../strings#long-string-literals).

## Precedence

Operators and other syntactic elements have precedence, like in other
languages. From highest to lowest:

[Postfix operators](#postfix-operators):

```txt
  ++    --
```

[Math operators](#math-operators):

```txt
  -    ~    (unary operators)
  *    /    %
  +    -
  <<    >>>    >>
  &
  ^
  |
```

[Type operators](#type-operators)

```txt
  is    is not    as
```

[Comparison operators](#comparison-operators)

```txt
  ==    !=    <    <=    >    >=
```

[Calls and arguments](#calls-and-arguments)

[Logical operators](#logical-operators)

```txt
  not
  and
  or
  ?:
```

[Assignment operators](#assignment-operators)

```txt
  =  :=  ::=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  |=  ^=  &=  <<=  >>=  >>>=
```

### Postfix operators

The postfix operators, `++` and `--` have the highest precedence. Thus
the following two lines are equivalent:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MyClass: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static x/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static y/int := 0 -->

```
  z1 := x + y++
  z2 := x + (y++)
```

Toit does not have the prefix forms of `++` and `--`:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->

```
  for i :=0; i < 10; ++i:  // Error!  There is no prefix ++.
    // ...
```

### Math operators

The [math](../math) operators have the next highest precedence. In order of
descending precedence the order is:

- Unary operators, `-` `~`
- Multiplicative operators, `*` `/` `%`
- Additive operators, `+` `-`
- Bit-shift operators, `<<` `>>>` `>>`
- Bit-and operator, `&`
- Bit-xor operator, `^`
- Bit-or operator, `|`

Thus the following pairs of lines are equivalent:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MyClass3: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static x/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static y/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static z/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static mask/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static distance/int := 0 -->

```
  a1 := ~x * 3
  a2 := (~x) * 3

  a3 := 4 + 2 * 3
  a4 := 4 + (2 * 3)

  a5 := x >> y + 1
  a6 := x >> (y + 1)

  a7 := x & mask << distance
  a8 := x & (mask << distance)

  b1 := x ^ y & z
  b2 := x ^ (y & z)

  b3 := x | y ^ z
  b4 := x | (y ^ z)
```

The math operators group from left to right. Thus the following pairs of lines
are equivalent

```
  b5 := x / y / z
  b6 := (x / y) / z

  b7 := x * y / z
  b8 := (x * y) / z
```

Note that the [bitwise operators](../math#bit-operations) have higher
precedence than the comparison operators in Toit. This is like Dart, but
unlike C and Java. Thus the following are equivalent in Toit, but not in C:

```
  c1 := x & 1 == 0
  c2 := (x & 1) == 0
```

See the full documentation of operators on
[`int`](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-int) and
[`float`](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-float).

### Type operators

The next operators in the precedence order are the type operators, `is`, `is not`, and `as`.

`is` and `is not` return a boolean depending on whether the runtime type
of the left hand side has the type on the right.

`as` is a cast, which dynamically checks the type and returns a value with the
correct static type:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function 0 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -->

```
my-function x y:
  if x is int:
    // Code that can use x as an integer
  if y is not string:
    // y must be something other than string
  // The programmer knows somehow that y is a number.  This checks
  // that the programmer is right and allows the program to pass the
  // compiler's type checker:
  return (y as num) + 1
```

### Comparison operators

The next operators in the precedence order are the comparison operators,
`==` `!=` `<` `<=` `>` `>=`.

Thus the following pairs of lines are equivalent:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MyClass2: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static x/int := 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static y/int := 0 -->

```
  c3 := x + 1 <= y * 2
  c4 := (x + 1) >= (y * 2)

  c5 := x + 1 <= y & -2
  c6 := (x + 1) >= (y & -2)  // Equivalent in Toit, not in C.
```

The comparison operators form a group with ternary and other
n-ary forms so that they can be used in the mathematical way. Thus the
following pairs are equivalent:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE my-function2 x y z from to base level top size: -->

```
  // Test that x is in the range [0, y).
  if 0 <= x < y:
    // ...
  if 0 <= x and x < y:
    // ...

  // Test that 'from' and 'to' are in the range [0, size),
  // and that 'from' is less than or equal to 'to'.
  if 0 <= from <= to < size:
    // ...
  if 0 <= from and from <= to and to < size:
    // ...

  // Test that 'base' is equal to 0, and that 'level' is in the
  // range [0, top).
  if 0 == base <= level < top:
    // ...
  if 0 == base and base <= level and level < top:
    // ...
```

### Calls and arguments

Calls and arguments are done with spaces in Toit, not with
parentheses and commas. Thus we write:

```
import math show *

my-function x y z:
  foo x y z          // In C: foo(x, y, z)
  c7 := 2 * (sin x)  // In C: 2 * sin(x)
```

The mathematical operators all have higher precedence than calls,
so the following are equivalent:

<!-- ALLOW WARNING -->
```
  foo x + 1 y + 2 z + 3
  foo (x + 1) (y + 2) (z + 3)

  cos x + PI / 4    // In C: cos(x + PI / 4)
  cos (x + PI / 4)  // In C: cos(x + PI / 4)
  cos(x + PI / 4)   // Looks like C call syntax.
```

<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function 0 0 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE foo x y z: -->

The third form, with the redundant parentheses and no space, looks like
a C-style call syntax. However this is an illusion:

```
import math show *

my-function x/float y/float:
  acos(x) + 100   // Not what it looks like!
  acos (x + 100)  // Equivalent!

  atan2 x y       // Correct.
  atan2(x, y)     // Syntax error!
```
<!-- ALLOW WARNING -->

<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function 0.0 0.0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function 0 0 0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   my-function true true 0 0 -->

### Logical operators

In descending precedence order:

- `not`
- `and`
- `or`
- `?:` (the ternary operator)

The first three match the names used in Python and C++. In
C++ these alphabetical forms are rarely used, and
it is more common to see the symbolic forms, `&&`, `||`, and `!`.
The symbolic forms are not available in Toit.

The following pairs are equivalent:

```
my-function a b c:
  if not a and b == 0:
    // ...
  if (not a) and (b == 0):
    // ...

  if a == 0 or b == 0 and c == 0:
    // ...
  if (a == 0) or ((b == 0) and (c == 0)):
    // ...
```

Since the logical operators are lower than the calls and arguments
we have to group them:

```
my-unary-function x/bool:
  // ...

is-odd x/int -> bool:
  return x % 2 == 1

my-function condition-a/bool condition-b/bool x/int y/int:
  my-unary-function (condition-a and condition-b)  // Parentheses needed.

  // The following two forms are equivalent.
  if is-odd x and is-odd y:
    // ...
  if (is-odd x) and (is-odd y):
    // ...
```

### Assignment operators

The lowest operators in the precedence order are the assignment operators,
`=` `:=` `::=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `|=` `^=` `&=` `<<=` `>>=` `>>>=`.

Since they are below the logical operators and calls, we can write
equivalently:

```
  angle-1 := atan2 x y
  angle-2 := (atan2 x y)

  condition-1 := condition-a and condition-b
  condition-2 := (condition-1 and condition-b)
```

Assignment operators are only allowed at the start of statements and
in the first clause of a `for`, `if`, or `while` statement.

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import reader show Reader -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE my-function3 reader/Reader str/string: -->

```
  while data := reader.read:
    // data was not null.

  if parsed := (int.parse str --on-error=: null):
    // parsed is not null and thus a valid number.
```
