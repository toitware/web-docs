# Toit syntax fundamentals

This document describes the basics of the Toit language. To learn about Toit's documentation convention, see the [Language documentation convention](https://docs.toit.io/language/toitdoc/) section.

## Whitespace and indentation

Toit uses whitespace and indentation to construct the code structure:
comment. For example:
```
// Defines globals first, and then uses main function to
// print out something.
i := 1
j := 10

main:
  while i < j:
    print i
    i = i + 1

```

## Comments

In Toit, a single line comment begins with a double slash `//` followed by the comment. For example:
```

// This is a single line comment in Toit.

```

For multiline comments, use `*/`.

```

/*
some multiline
comment
*/

```



## Identifiers and keywords

Identifiers are names that identify globals, locals, functions, classes, modules, and other objects in Toit.

* Identifier names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_), but cannot contain spaces.
* Identifiers need to start with a letter or an underscore (_), but not with a number. The following characters can be alphanumeric or underscore.
* Toit identifiers are case-sensitive.
* Identifier names cannot be the same as keywords and built-in functions in Toit.

The following Toit keywords cannot be used for naming identifiers:

```txt
as          abstract       assert
break       class          continue
else        false          finally
for         if             import
export      null           return
static      true           try
while       or     and     not
```

In addition to these keywords, there are some "pseudo keywords" - like `constructor` - that cannot be used in certain contexts. Trying these pseudo-keywords as globals name will generally give an error message in the IDE.

Another example of pseudo-keyword is `operator` that is allowed as a local but cannot be the name of a function. Similarly, `string` can be used like a normal global but would shadow the `string` type.

## String and character literals

Single quotes for are used for character literals and are equivalent to
integer literals of the corresponding Unicode code point, or
rune.

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE main: -->
```
  print 'A' // Prints "65", the ASCII code of 'A'.
  print '*' // Prints "42", the ASCII code of '*'.
  print 'æ' // Prints "230", the Unicode code point of 'æ'
  print '€' // Prints "8364", the Unicode code point of the Euro symbol.
  a /int := 'a'  // a now contains the integer 97.
```

Toit uses only double quotes `"` to denote a string literal:
```
  print "Hello, World!"
  str := "a string"  // str has type string.
```

If a string contains a double quote, a backslash, or a dollar sign,
you must use the backslash `\` to
[escape](../strings#escaped-characters) it. The backslash
can also be used for characters that are [difficult to
type](../strings#escaped-characters)
For example:
```
message := "This is a \"valid\" string"
```

The unescaped operator `$` is used for [string
interpolation](../strings#string-interpolation).

The methods available on string objects are documented in
the [string class](https://libs.toit.io/core/class-string).
See also the [guide to Toit strings](../strings).

## Toit globals and constants

The `:=` operator introduces a new global variable with the name of the given identifier (here "global_name").

```
global_name := 103
```

If the global is final (that is, can't be assigned to), then you can use `::=` as in:
```
global_number ::= 42
```
Note that this in this case, `global_number` is actually a constant, and should thus be written in capital characters:
```
GLOBAL_NUMBER ::= 42
```
A final global that isn't a constant could be something that is mutable itself, such as
```
some_global ::= []
```
In this case the global is initialized with an empty list. The content of the list can change, but it will always be the same list.

When you name a global, you should adhere to rules defined earlier about [identifiers](../syntax#identifiers-and-keywords).

Global variables (and [static class
variables](../definitions)) are initialized when
they are first used.  This is noticeable if their value is
determined by some function call, for example `Time.now`

```
TIME ::= Time.now  // Time.now is called on first use of TIME.

main:
  print "time: $Time.now"  // Print time at program start.
  sleep --ms=2000          // Sleep for two seconds.
  print "TIME: $TIME"      // Print the global constant.
  sleep  --ms=100
  print "TIME: $TIME"      // The global constant remains unchanged.
```

This program will print two different times, the second one twice.

## Indexing syntax

Indexing into lists, maps, byte arrays, and strings can be
done with square brackets, `[]`.  The first element has an
index of zero.

For example, an ASCII string is a sequence of characters,
and you can access can access its elements using square
brackets [] and indexes.

<!-- RESET CODE -->
```
str := "Toit String"
byte_array := #[1, 42, 103]
list := [1, 10, 100, 1000]
map := {
  "foo": 42,
  "bar": 103,
}

main:
  print str[0]         // Prints "84", the ASCII code of 'T'.
  print byte_array[1]  // Prints "42", the byte at position 1.
  print list[3]        // Prints "1000", the integer at position 3.
  print map["foo"]     // Prints "42", the value with the key "foo".
```

Indexing into strings is done by [UTF-8 byte
offset](../strings#string-representation), so the
story is a little more complex for non-ASCII strings.

Toit also has support for slices.  These are views into part
of a list, byte array, or string:

```
  print str[0..4] // Prints "Toit", the first 4 bytes of "Toit String".
  print str[..4]  // Prints "Toit", the first 4 bytes of "Toit String".
  print str[5..]  // Prints "String", the last part of "Toit String".
```

See also the [description of slice
syntax](../strings#slices-of-strings) in the string
guide.

A slice may keep the underlying object alive, preventing a
garbage collection.  To avoid that you can use `copy` to
create a new object containing only the elements in the
slice:

```
long_lived_global/ByteArray := #[]

my_function:
  huge := ByteArray 1000000
  // The slice keeps huge alive:
  long_lived_global = huge[1000..1050]
  // Makes a copy, so huge can be garbage collected:
  long_lived_global = long_lived_global.copy
```

## Continuation of statements

Toit uses a newline character to separate statements. It places each statement on one line.
However in a long list of arguments for a function call you
can use a new line for each argument.

A long statement can also span multiple lines by using the backslash (\) character.

The following example illustrates how to use per-argument
newlines, or the backslash (\) character to continue a
statement in the second line:
```
// A method with many parameters.
foo a b c d e f g h i j: ...

main:
  some_long_local1 := 1
  some_long_local2 := 2
  some_long_local3 := 3
  some_long_local4 := 4
  some_long_local5 := 5
  some_long_local6 := 6
  some_long_local7 := 7
  some_long_local8 := 8
  some_long_local9 := 9
  some_long_local10 := 10
  // Once there is a newline, all further arguments must be
  // on their own line:
  foo some_long_local1 some_long_local2 some_long_local3
    some_long_local4
    some_long_local5
    some_long_local6
    some_long_local7
    some_long_local8
    some_long_local9
    some_long_local10
  // We can also write all of them in one line:
  foo some_long_local1 some_long_local2 some_long_local3 some_long_local4 some_long_local5 some_long_local6 some_long_local7 some_long_local8 some_long_local9 some_long_local10
  // But that becomes hard to read fast.
  // If we want to cut the line at some point we need a `\` to conceptually continue the first line:
  foo some_long_local1 some_long_local2 some_long_local3 \
      some_long_local4 some_long_local5 some_long_local6 \
      some_long_local7 some_long_local8 some_long_local9 \
      some_long_local10
```
