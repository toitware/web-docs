# Booleans

In Toit, the boolean type is `bool` and its two values are written `true` and `false`.

Whenever built-in constructs need to evaluate a condition (for example in an `if` or a `while`), then Toit first "boolifies" the given value. The values `false` and `null` are treated like `false` and every other value is converted to `true`.
So in a condition context, `null` is falsy and other non-booleans are truthy.

```
main:
  t := true
  if t:
    print "This is printed because t boolifies to true."
  f := false
  if f:
    // 'f' boolifies to false.
    unreachable
  n := null
  if n:
    // null in a condition boolifies to false.
    unreachable
  str := ""
  if str:
    // Strings, like every non-false non-null, object boolifies to true.
    print "This branch is executed."
  z := 0
  if z:
    // As before: 0, neither being false, nor being null, is boolified to true.
    print "This branch is executed"
  list := []
  if list:
    print "This branch is reached"

// Boolification only occurs in `if`, `for`, and `while`
// conditions.
b1/bool := null // Error: null is not a bool!
b2/bool := s // Error: A string is not a bool!
b3/bool := z // Error: A number is not a bool!
b4/bool := l // Error: A list is not a bool!

```
