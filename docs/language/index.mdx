# Language basics

This quick-start guide is inspired by [Ruby in Twenty
Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/). It makes the
assumption that you have [Jaguar installed](../../getstarted/device)
on your machine.

Toit is an [open source](https://github.com/toitlang/toit), [object-oriented](./objects-constructors-inheritance-interfaces)
programming language for the Internet of Things. The Toit language has the following desirable properties:

- Modern, simple, and approachable
- High-level and object-oriented
- Declarative and statically analyzable
- Safe and garbage collected

Now, let's get started with some programming!

## Hello, World

The Toit SDK and Jaguar CLI both support running small programs directly from the command line.
If you put the following code in a file called `hello.toit`:

```
main:
  print "Hello World!"
```

you can run it from the command line like this:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hello World!
```

What just happened? The `jag` command line tool read your source code
(`hello.toit`) and started running it from the `main` method that you defined.
The `main` method consists of all the indented statements just below the method
declaration line `main:`. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces
you add to your programs are significant.
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hello World!
```

What just happened? The `toit.run` command line tool read your source code
(`hello.toit`) and started running it from the `main` method that you defined.
The `main` method consists of all the indented statements just below the method
declaration line `main:`. Toit is indentation-based like Python, so the spaces
you add to your programs are significant.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Once the program ran, it printed `Hello World!` in your terminal. This is
because the only statement in `hello.toit` is a method call, where you invoke
the `print` method with a single argument, which is the [string](./strings) to
be printed (in this case to the terminal). If you wanted to output more than
one line from your program, you could update it to:

```
main:
  print "Hello World!"
  print "Hello World!"
```

When you run the updated program, you will see two lines of output:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello World!
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Defining a function

What if you want to say "Hello" a lot without getting your fingers all tired? You should define another function:

```
hi:
  print "Hello World!"
```

and call that from `main`:

```
main:
  hi
  hi
```

Calling a function in Toit is as simple as mentioning its name. If the function
doesn't take arguments that's all you need.

What if we want to say hello to one person, and not the whole world? Just redefine hi to take a name as an argument.

```
hi name:
  print "Hello $name!"
```

This way, `hi` is a function that takes a single argument. We can use that from `main`:

```
main:
  hi "Lars"
  hi "Kasper"
```

and it works!

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Inserting strings in strings

What's the `$name` bit? That's Toit's way of inserting something into a string.
It is called [_string interpolation_](./strings#string-interpolation).
The bit after the `$` is turned into a string (if it isn't one already) and
then substituted into the outer string at that point. You can also use this to
make sure that someone's name is properly trimmed so leading and trailing
whitespace is ignored:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
```
hi name="World":
  print "Hello, $name.trim!"
```

This way, we call the `trim` function on the `name` string before we insert it
into the outer string. If we call `hi " Lars "` we still get the familiar
greeting `Hello Lars!` and not `Hello Lars !`. You can add parentheses
around the `name.trim` expression in the string to make it clearer which parts
belong to the outer string:

```
  print "Hello, $(name.trim)!"
```

Maybe you already spotted that we went ahead and added one other trick to the
code above? We added a default value for the `name` parameter, so if the name
isn't supplied when you call `hi`, we use the default name "World". Now we can
try:

```
main:
  hi
  hi "Kasper"
```

and get the following output:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hello World!
Hello Kasper!
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Evolving into a greeter

What if we want a real greeter around, one that remembers your name and
welcomes you and treats you with respect. You might want to use an object for
that. Let's create a `Greeter` class:

```
class Greeter:
  name := null

  constructor .name="World":

  say-hi: print "Hi $name.trim!"

  say-bye: print "Bye $name.trim, come back soon."
```

The new keyword here is `class`. This defines a new class called `Greeter` and
a bunch of methods for that class. Methods are just functions that are attached
to an object. Pay special attention to the method `constructor`. There is
nothing after the `:` and the `constructor` method isn't followed by any
indented lines, so the constructor has no statements in it:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->

```
  constructor .name="World":
```

This is a
[constructor](./objects-constructors-inheritance-interfaces#constructors)
and it defines how you can construct objects from the class. It says the class
`Greeter` takes a single argument (`name`), but the `.` prefix to the `.name`
parameter actually tells us that the name is immediately stored as a field on
`Greeter` objects. The field is defined just above the constructor with the
`:=` syntax.

The field parameter `.name` still has a default value, so if we don't pass a name, the `Greeter` will greet the world.

The `say-hi` and `say-bye` methods are introduced on the next two lines. The
methods both have a single statement in them, so we can keep them on one line
each. The `say-hi` and `say-bye` method both use the `name` field from the
object they are called on. You can refer to fields in the class of a method
simply by mentioning them (`name`).

## Creating a greeter object

Now let's create a greeter object and use it:

```
main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  greeter.say-hi
  greeter.say-bye
```

We create an object simply by mentioning the constructor, `Greeter`. The
greeter object remembers the name and uses it for the two separate greetings.
If we run this, we get the following output:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hi Helena!
Bye Helena, come back soon.
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you want to get the name from a greeter, you can ask a greeter by calling the `name` method on it:

```
main:
  greeter := Greeter " Helena "
  print "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
```

This would show `How are you Helena ?`. Almost neat, right? Unfortunately, the
name isn't trimmed like we expected. Let's fix that!

## Fields and methods

As you have just seen, a field on an object introduces a method with the same
name. If you wanted to hide a field from the outside world, you could make it
private. By convention, methods and fields that end with an underscore (`_`)
are private and not supposed to be touched from the outside:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class Greeter:
  name_ := null
  constructor .name_="World":
```

This removes the `name` method from greeters, but if we really want to allow
accessing the name from the outside, we could reintroduce a getter with the
same meaning as before.

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_="World":

  name: return name_
  say-hi: print "Hi $name_.trim!"
  say-bye: print "Bye $name_.trim, come back soon."
```

Here we use the new keyword `return` to specify the value a method returns. We
could make it slightly more interesting and trim it in the process:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->

```
  name: return name_.trim
```

In this way, access to the name from the outside also gets the trimming and we
can avoid having to manually call `trim` when getting the name:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class Greeter:
  name_ := null

  constructor .name_="World":

  name: return name_.trim
  say-hi: print "Hi $name!"
  say-bye: print "Bye $name, come back soon."
```

We can check that it works by running:

```
main:
  greeter := Greeter " Erik "
  print "How are you $(greeter.name)?"
```

and you should see `How are you Erik?`. `greeter` is a local variable, only visible in the
`main` method. We declared it with the `:=` syntax, just like we used `:=` to declare
member variables in classes.

## Greetings everyone!

This greeter isn't all that interesting though, it can only deal with one
person at a time. What if we had some kind of MegaGreeter that could either
greet the world, one person, or a whole list of people? Let's try to build
that. We will start with a class definition:

```
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name="World":
    names.add name
```

So MegaGreeter objects have a [list](./listsetmap) of `names`. The `names`
field is initialized to the empty list (`[]`). The body of the `MegaGreeter`
constructor adds the given `name` argument to the end of the list of names.
Notice that this is different than using a `.name` parameter that automatically
assigns to the field called `name`. Mega greeters don't have a single name and
no `name` field, so here the `name` is just an ordinary parameter that we can
use in the body of the constructor. All in all, this code:

```
main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  print "The names are $greeter.names"
```

will lead to this output:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
The names are [World]
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
The names are [World]
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

We can now go ahead and add greeter methods that show all the names:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []

  constructor name="World":
    names.add name

  say-hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: print "Hello $it!"
  say-bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    print "Bye $everyone, come back soon."

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say-hi
  greeter.say-bye

  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.names.add "Rikke"
  greeter.say-hi
  greeter.say-bye
```

If you run this, you'll get this output:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Jaguar">

```txt
$ jag run -d host hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="toitlang.org">

```txt
$ toit.run hello.toit
Hello World!
Bye World, come back soon.
Hello World!
Hello Lars!
Hello Kasper!
Hello Rikke!
Bye World, Lars, Kasper, Rikke, come back soon.
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's dive into the new constructs in the next sections.

## Comments and indentation

Not everything in your source files is meant to be run by the Toit compiler.
Sometimes, it is nice just to add comments that explain interesting things
related to your code. In the example in the last section, there were a few
single line comments:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->

```
// Greeter that says hi to everybody.
class MegaGreeter:
```

Such comments start with `//` and tell the system to ignore the rest of the line.

You have already seen the use of indentation to give hierarchical structure to
your code. The general structure is that after a `:` you can have a single
construct if it fits on one line:

```
class SimpleGreeter:

  say-hi: print "Hi!"  // Method all on one line.
```

or you can add a newline after the `:` and let the following lines that are
indented relative to the outer construct be a sequence of inner constructs:

```
  names := []

  // Method delimited by indentation
  say-bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    print "Bye $everyone, come back soon."
```

For methods, we often refer to the inner constructs as the statements of a
method or the body of a method. The preferred indentation for inner constructs
is two spaces.

For a class, everything that is indented under the class declaration line
belongs to the class. We call such things class members:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class MegaGreeter:
  // class members start
  // ...
  // class members end
```

For methods in a class, the statements in them are nested one level further (two spaces) than the class members:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class MegaGreeter:
  // class members start
  // ...
  say-hi:
    // method body start
    // ...
    // method body end
  // ...
  // class members end
```

It is common to refer to such nested structure as _block structure_.

## Iterating over lists

Let's return to the `MegaGreeter` example and take a look at another place
where constructs are block structured. In the `say-hi` method, we want to call
`print` for every single name in the `names` [list](./listsetmap). We can do
this by calling `names.do` and provide the list of statements we want to run
for each element using block structure:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MegaGreeter: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   names := [] -->

```
  say-hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: print "Hello $it!"
```

Here the statement is on a single line, so there is no need to use indentation.
When using `names.do`, a method available on all
[collections](./listsetmap), the [special variable
`it`](./blocks-and-lambdas#block-arguments) contains the individual elements from the list in
turn. If there are 5 elements in the `names` list, we will call `print` 5 times
producing 5 separate lines of output.

You can play with the methods on list by modifying and running the sample below:

```
main:
  list := [ "Horse", "Fish", "Radish", "Baboon" ]
  print "There are $(list.size) elements in the list"
  print "Here they are:"
  list.do: print "Element = $it"

  print "Here they are (sorted):"
  list.sort --in-place
  list.do: print "Element = $it"
```

One of the methods on lists that is very useful when constructing strings is
`join`. It produces a string from a list of strings by joining the parts and
adding a separator between them. We use this in the `MegaGreeter` example to
produce a single comma-separated list of names for the single line output of
`say-bye`:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MegaGreeter: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   names := [] -->

```
  say-bye:
    everyone := names.join ", "
    print "Bye $everyone, come back soon."
```

## Named arguments

Perhaps you don't always want to say "Hello", so you add an argument with a default value to the `say-hi` method:

```
  say-hi greeting="Hello,":
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: print "$greeting $it!"
```

Now the user of your class can write:

```
main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.say-hi "Kaixo,"
```

Which produces the output:

```txt
Kaixo, World!
Kaixo, Lars!
Kaixo, Kasper!
```

However, at the calling site it may not be clear what the argument "Kaixo" is
for. We can make it clearer with a named argument:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MegaGreeter: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   names := [] -->

```
  say-hi --greeting="Hello,":
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: print "$greeting $it!"
```

Now we can use this with:

```
main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.say-hi
  greeter.names.add "Lars"
  greeter.names.add "Kasper"
  greeter.say-hi --greeting="Hej,"
```

which outputs:

```txt
Hello, World!
Hej, World!
Hej, Lars!
Hej, Kasper!
```

## If statements and basic expressions

We can program a ridiculously inefficient Fibonacci sequence generator using `if` and recursion:

```
fib n:
  if n <= 1: return n
  return (fib n - 1) + (fib n - 2)

main:
  print "The 10th Fibonacci number is $(fib 10)"
```

This defines a top-level function called `fib` that is not a member of any
class. (We already saw `main`, which is a top level function with a special
name.)

The `fib` function is recursive, calling itself, and also makes use of a few
new features. The [if-statement](./loops#if-statements) is well known from
other languages. In Toit it works by taking an expression and conditionally
evaluating a block. Like other blocks we could have used indentation to group
multiple lines.

Toit also has the usual array of infix operators, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` etc.
and the relational operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==` and `!=`. The
operators have higher [precedence](./syntax#precedence) than function
arguments, so we had to group the calls in parentheses to get the desired
behavior. The high precedence is what makes the arguments for the recursive
invocation of `fib` work.

## Loops

This is a terribly slow way to calculate a Fibonacci number though, and we
could do it with a simple [loop](./loops#loops):

```
fib2 n:
  s1 := 0
  s2 := 1
  n.repeat:
    s3 := s1 + s2
    s1 = s2
    s2 = s3
  return s1
```

Here we are using the `repeat` method on numbers, which runs a block a given
number of times. Like for the `do` method, there's an automatic variable, `it`
that gives the iteration number:

```
// Prints the numbers from 0 to n (exclusive).
print-n-numbers n:
  n.repeat: print it
```

The `repeat` method is simple and efficient, but sometimes we need something
more flexible, and for that we have the well-known `while` and `for`
statements:

```
// Prints the odd numbers less than n.
print-odd-numbers n:
  for i := 1; i < n; i += 2:
    print i

// Returns if the Collatz conjecture is true.
collatz n:
  while n > 1:
    if n % 2 == 0: n = n / 2
    else: n = n * 3 + 1
```

## Maps and sets

Perhaps we need titles for our greeters:

<!-- RESET CODE -->

```
class MegaGreeter:
  names := []
  titles := {:}

  constructor:

  add name title:
    names.add name
    titles[name] = title
  say-hi:
    // Greet everyone individually!
    names.do: print "Hello, $titles[it] $it!"

main:
  greeter := MegaGreeter
  greeter.add "Lars" "Mr."
  greeter.add "Rikke" "Dr."
  greeter.add "Günter" "Herr Professor Doktor Doktor"
  greeter.say-hi
```

Here we use a [hash map](./listsetmap) to store the appropriate title for each
name. The empty map is given by `{:}` and we use `[]` to access the values for
each key. The empty set is `{}` and we already met the empty list, `[]`. The
lookup syntax `[]` also works on lists, so instead of the 'do' method we could
have used:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class MegaGreeter: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   names := [] -->

```
  say-hi:
    for i := 0; i < names.size; i++:
      print "Hello, $names[i]"
```

## Blocks and lambdas

We already saw the `repeat` method on integers and the `do` method on lists:

```
main:
  // Print the numbers from 1 to 10, one per line.
  10.repeat:
    print it + 1
  my-list := [1, 2, 3]
  // Print the elements in my-list, one per line.
  my-list.do:
    print it
```

Syntactically they look like they are built in to the language like `if` and
`for`, but they are actually normal methods on the List and int classes:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->

```
class List:
  // ...
  do [block]:
    size.repeat: block.call this[it]

class int:
  // ...
  repeat [block]:
    for i := 0; i < this; i++:
      block.call i
```

They are making use of a feature called [blocks](./blocks-and-lambdas). These are
snippets of code that can be passed down the stack as arguments to methods and
functions. At the call site we precede the block with a colon, '`:`', and at
the function definition we surround the parameter name with square brackets,
'`[]`'. Often, there is one block parameter, it is in the final position and
it is called `block`.

If a callback needs to survive the scope in which it is defined, we can't use
blocks. Instead, we can use [lambdas](./blocks-and-lambdas#lambdas):

```
// Returns a function that adds n to its argument.
add-n n -> Lambda:
  return (:: it + n)
```

The syntax for lambdas is the same as for blocks, except that the we use `::`
instead of `:`. The lambda above is a function that takes a single argument and
returns the sum of that argument and `n`. We can use it like this:

```
main:
  add-5 := add-n 5
  print (add-5.call 10)
```

This will print `15`.

## Blocks and lambdas with multiple arguments

Blocks and lambdas can have parameters, just like methods. The parameters are
listed after the `::` or `:`. Here is an example of a block with two parameters:

```
main:
  map := { "Lars": 1, "Kasper": 2 }
  map.do: | key value |
    print "$key has value $value"
```

The block in the `do` method has two parameters, `key` and `value`. The `do`
method will call the block with each key-value pair in the map.

## Blocks and lambdas that return a value

A block or lambda can return a value each time it is run. This is used for example
in the `filter` method on lists.

```
// Takes a list of words, and returns a new list with only the
// words that are 5 characters or fewer.
short-words words:
  return words.filter:
    it.size <= 5
```

The `filter` method calls the block, `it.size <= 5` for each element in the
original list, and returns a new list containing only the short words.

Note that there is no `return` statement in the block. A block will return the
value of the last statement to the place where it was invoked with
`block.call`. In this case there is only one statement, which is the
[boolean](./booleans) expression `it.size <= 5`.

If you use the `return` keyword in a block then it returns from the syntactic
function or method in which it is written. Usually this will behave as you
would expect:

```
wheres-walter list:
  list.do:
    if it.starts-with "Walter ":
      return it
  return null

main:
  print (wheres-walter ["Ib Michael", "Walter White", "Marie Curie"])
```

The `return` keyword is inside a block that is passed to the `do` method. When
the name that starts with `"Walter "` is found we immediately return the full
name from the `wheres-walter` function without continuing to iterate over the
list.
