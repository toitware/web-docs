# Mathematics in Toit

Find mathematical algorithms in the
[math module](https://libs.toit.io/math/library-summary), and the numbers available
in the [numbers module](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/library-summary) of
the core library.

## Numbers

Toit [numbers](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/library-summary) support integers and floats.

### Integers and floats

[Integers](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-int) are whole numbers such
as -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .. and they have type `int`.
[Floats](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-float) are numbers with a
decimal point. Floats are contagious, meaning that any binary operation
involving a float forces the other operand to be converted to a float before
doing the operation (thus yielding a float as result).

Integers are 64-bit signed integers.
Floats are of size 64-bit, following the
[IEEE 754-1985 double format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).

To make large numbers more readable, digits are often grouped using underscores.
When storing these values and when displaying them on screen, Toit just ignores the underscores.

Underscores work for both [integers](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-LargeInteger) and floats.

You can use the [mathematics
operators](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-num) such as `+`, `-`, `*`,
and `/` to form expressions that include numbers.
The [int class](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-int) has additional
operations (like bit-shifting) that are not supported by the floating point
numbers.

Additional mathematical constants and functions are available in the
[math module](https://libs.toit.io/math/library-summary).

```
import math

main:
  print (math.pow 2 10)
```

## Randomization

`random` is a function included in the
[core library](https://libs.toit.io/core/utils/library-summary#random(0%2C0%2C0%2C))

`random 10` gives you a random number between 0 and 10 (10 exclusive).

`random 3 5` gives you a random number between 3 and 5 (5 exclusive).

## Range

To create a range similar to the built-in function in Python:

```
range from/int to/int step=1 [block]:
  if step > 0:
    for i := from; i < to; i += step:
      block.call i
  else:
    for i := from; i > to; i += step:
      block.call i

main:
  range 5 10:
    print it  // Logs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  range 10 20 2:
    print it  // Logs 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.
```

## Bit operations

The bit operations on integers work on 64 bit signed twos-complement
numbers.  Thus the shift operators can take shift distances of up to 63:

```
  print 0x8000_0000_0000_0000 >>> 63  // >> 1
```

The shift-right operator, `>>` preserves the sign of its input, while
the unsigned shift-right operator `>>>` shifts in zeros, which can
give a positive result for a negative input.


```
  print -20 >> 2  // >> -5
  print -20 >>> 2 // >> 4611686018427387899
```

Shifting further than 63 will shift all bits out, rather than being
undefined behavior (in C and C++) or taking the modulus of the
shift distance (in Java):

```
  print -20 >> 64  // >> -1
  print -20 >>> 64 // >> 0
```

[`int`](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-int) and
[`float`](https://libs.toit.io/core/numbers/class-float).
