# Mathematics in Toit

Find mathematical algorithms in the [math module](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib/math.toit), and the numbers available in the [numbers module](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit) of the core library.

## Numbers

Toit [numbers](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit) support integers and floats.

### Integers and floats

[Integers](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit/int) are whole numbers such as -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, .. and they have type `int`.
[Floats](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit/float) are numbers with a decimal point. Floats are contagious, meaning that any binary operation involving a float forces the other operand to be converted to a float before doing the operation (thus yielding a float as result).

Integers are 64-bit signed integers.
Floats are of size 64-bit, following the [IEEE 754-1985 double format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).

To make large numbers more readable, digits are often grouped using underscores.
When storing these values and when displaying them on screen, Toit just ignores the underscores.

Underscores work for both [integers](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit/LargeInteger) and floats.

You can use the [mathematics operators](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit/num) such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` to form expressions that include numbers.
The [int class](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/numbers.toit/int) has additional operations (like bit-shifting) that are not supported by the floating point numbers.

Additional mathematical constants and functions are available in the [math module](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib/math.toit).

```
import math

main:
  print (math.pow 2 10)
```

## Randomization

`random` is a function included in the core library.

`random 10` gives you a random number between 0 and 10 (10 exclusive).

`random 3 5` gives you a random number between 3 and 5 (5 exclusive).

## Range

To create a range similar to the built-in function in Python:

```
range from/int to/int step=1 [block]:
  if step > 0:
    for i := from; i < to; i += step:
      block.call i
  else:
    for i := from; i > to; i += step:
      block.call i

main:
  range 5 10:
    print it  // Logs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  range 10 20 2:
    print it  // Logs 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.
```

## Sorting

`sort` is a method of the class [List](https://libs.toit.io/#/lib.core/collections.toit/List).

To sort a list of numbers from biggest to smallest number and extract the smallest number

```
main:
  list := [3, 2, 5, 1]
  sorted := list.sort
  print sorted[0]
```

If the list should be sorted in place, avoiding the allocation of a fresh list

```
main:
  list := [3, 2, 5, 1]
  list.sort --in_place
  print list.first
```

To get the highest number of the sorted list

```
  print list.last
```

It is also possible to sort with a custom comparison by passing a block to the `sort` function

```
main:
  my_list := [1, 2, 5, 9]
  my_list.sort --in_place: | a b | b - a
  print my_list[0]
```

The block takes two arguments, which are here called `a` and `b` and should return (implicitly) a value that can be negative, zero, or positive.
Note that `| b -a | sorts in descending order.
