# Services
Services are Toit's way of communicating between different containers. They
use an RPC mechanism that allows containers to call predefined methods
across container boundaries. As such they are a natural way of separating
out complex drivers (like the ones for cellular modems), so they can run
in the own address spaces.

## Architecture
When working with services, there are four main concepts:
- a "service interface"
- a "service provider"
- a "service client"
- a "service manager"

The service interface describes the API the service provides.

A provider class then implements the service interface and
registers itself as a service provider.

A client class implements the actual RPC calls so that users of
the service can interact with the provider as if it was a local object.

The service manager is responsible for connecting clients and providers,
and for dispatching requests between them. It is part of the
system.

## Service interfaces
A service interface describes the functionality that a provider
offers to clients. The interface is identified by a UUID, together
with a major and minor version number. Each method furthermore gets a
unique integer.

For example:
<!-- CODE FILENAME service.toit -->
```
// service.toit.
import system.services show ServiceSelector

interface RandomGeneratorService:
  static SELECTOR ::= ServiceSelector
      --uuid="dd9e5fd1-a5e9-464e-b2ef-92bf15ea02ca"
      --major=0
      --minor=1

  generate limit/int -> int
  static GENERATE-INDEX ::= 1
```

The `RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR` constant will bind a
client of the service and the service implementation together. We typically
just generate random UUIDs, because all we need is some notion of identity.
The `dd9e5fd1-a5e9-464e-b2ef-92bf15ea02ca` constant was generated via
https://www.uuidgenerator.net/.

The `RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR.major` and
`RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR.minor` values
represent the current version of the interface. The version is used during
service discovery, because it is possible that a client will be trying to
access a newer or older implementation of the service due to the fact that
clients and implementations are decoupled and are likely to be updated
independently of each other.

The interface furthermore adds information on what the method for index
1 (`GENERATE-INDEX`) should look like. The underlying RPC mechanism doesn't
take advantage of this information. Provider and client implementations,
on the other hand, should use this information to implement the interface,
so they are compatible.

We currently manually assign indexes to methods, but
you could imagine generating the interface definition from something like a
[protocol buffer service](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and
have the indices automatically assigned. If you change the index of any
existing method you should bump the major version, but if you only add new
methods with previously unused indices, you can get away with just bumping the
minor version.

In a similar vein, we are investigating ways to automatically generate the
service provider and client code from the interface definition.

## Service providers
A service provider is an object that provides the functionality that the
service interface promises.

It registers itself with the service manager, and then
listens for incoming requests. The service manager connects clients and
providers, and dispatches requests between them.

For example, the aforementioned `RandomGeneratorService` could be
implemented as follows:

```
import system.services show ServiceProvider ServiceHandler
import .service

class RandomGeneratorServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
    implements ServiceHandler:

  constructor:
    super "test/random-generator" --major=7 --minor=9
    provides RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR --handler=this

  handle index/int arguments/any --gid/int --client/int -> any:
    if index == RandomGeneratorService.GENERATE-INDEX:
      return generate arguments
    unreachable

  generate limit/int -> int:
    print "got request to generate a random number with limit $limit"
    return random limit
```

The `RandomGeneratorServiceProvider` class extends the `ServiceProvider`
base clase which implements the communication with the service manager.

The arguments to the `super` call are the name of the service, and the
version of the service interface. These are not used by the service
manager, and are there mostly for debugging purposes. They are
fundamentally a description of the provider.

The `provides` call (invoking a method on the super class) declares the
selector this provider implements. There can be multiple calls to
`provides` if the provider implements multiple service interfaces.

The `provides` invocation takes a
`ServiceHandler` object as `--handler` argument. This object is
responsible for handling incoming requests. In most cases, the provider
itself will implement the `ServiceHandler` interface. However,
especially for providers that implement multiple service interfaces, it
can be useful, or even necessary, to have a separate handlers for each
interface. For example, a temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor
could implement three different service interfaces, and have a separate
handler for each.

Note that the `ServiceHandler` interface is just describing
a callback:
<!-- RESET CODE -->
```
interface ServiceHandler:
  handle index/int arguments/any --gid/int --client/int -> any
```

The `handle` method implements the actual service. It switches on
the index of the incoming request, and calls the appropriate method.

In this example the provider class actually implements the
`RandomGeneratorService` interface, and we could explicitly state
that by adding `implements RandomGeneratorService` to the class.
However, to give the developer more flexibility in implementing
the service, we generally don't add the `implements` clause.

<Note>

Before a provider can be used, it must be registered with the service
manager by calling `install` on the provider object.

</Note>

### Using a service provider
Typically, a service provider is installed in its own container where
the `main` function simply installs the provider:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE class RandomGeneratorServiceProvider: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   install: -->
```
...

main:
  provider := RandomGeneratorServiceProvider
  provider.install
```

For testing (or on a desktop machine), it can also be useful to spawn the
provider process from the client process:

```
...

main:
  spawn::
    provider := RandomGeneratorServiceProvider
    provider.install

  // Do client stuff here.
```

### Service provider lifecycle
A service provider is a long-lived object. It is usually installed
when the container starts, and stays alive until the container is
forcefully stopped. In [Artemis](../../../getstarted/fleet) containers
that run providers should be marked as `background` so they don't
prevent the system to go to deep sleep.

For each client that connects to a provider, the `on-opened` method
is called. Similarly, when a client disconnects, the `on-closed`
method is called. These methods can be used to keep track of the
number of connected clients, and to perform setup actions or cleanups.

For example, a driver that requires an external peripheral to be
powered on could use the `on-opened` method to power on the peripheral,
and the `on-closed` method to power it off again.

## Service clients
A service client is an object that provides the service functionality
to the client. It transparently forwards calls to the service
provider.

Once the client has connected to a provider (with the help of the
service manager), its main job consists of serializing the arguments
and return values, and to map the method calls to the appropriate
indexes.

For example, the aforementioned `RandomGeneratorService` could be
implemented as follows:

```
import system.services show ServiceClient ServiceSelector
import .service

class RandomGeneratorServiceClient extends ServiceClient:
  static SELECTOR ::= RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR

  constructor selector=SELECTOR:
    assert: selector.matches SELECTOR
    super selector

  generate limit/int -> int:
    return invoke_ RandomGeneratorService.GENERATE-INDEX limit
```

The `RandomGeneratorServiceClient` class extends the `ServiceClient`
base clase which implements the communication with the service manager.

The `super` call takes a `ServiceSelector` object as argument. This
object describes the service that the client wants to connect to. By
default the selector from the `RandomGeneratorService` interface is
used, but users can also provide their own selector as long as its
compatible (the `assert` call checks this).

The `generate` method then implements the actual service. It calls the
`invoke_` method on the super class, passing the index of the method
to call, and the arguments to the method. The `invoke_` method then
serializes the arguments, sends them to the service provider, and
waits for the response. It then deserializes the response and returns
it.

### Using a service client
A client needs the a provider to be available. See how to
[use providers](#using-a-service-provider) for more information.

The common way to use a service is to construct it and to `open` it. The
`open` call contacts the service manager and finds a matching provider.

```
main:
  client := RandomGeneratorServiceClient
  client.open
  10.repeat:
    print "random = $(client.generate 100)"
```

Often, the service can also be in a lazy-initialized constant:

<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
```
service_/RandomGeneratorServiceClient? ::= (RandomGeneratorServiceClient).open
    --if-absent=: null
```

The `--if-absent` block is invoked when we cannot find the requested service.
You can provide a timeout if you're willing to
wait a bit for the service to appear:

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class RandomGeneratorServiceClient: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   open --timeout [--if-absent]: return null -->
```
service_/RandomGeneratorServiceClient? ::= (RandomGeneratorServiceClient).open
    --timeout=(Duration --s=2)
    --if-absent=: null
```

## Serialization
As part of the communication between clients and providers, messages
are serialized in an efficient way. Messages must be either `null`,
integers, booleans, floats, strings, byte arrays, lists or maps.
Any type that is not one of these must be converted
before calling `invoke_`. In that case, the provider and client must agree
on how to encode the type.

For example, if we want to send more than one argument as an
RPC message we must encode them first. By convention, we
encode them as a list of the individual arguments.

<Note type="warning">

For a more efficient message passing, byte arrays **may** be transferred
directly, without copying. In that case, the original byte array
is "neutered" and reset to an empty byte array. This means that
the byte array cannot be used anymore after it has been sent.

</Note>

## Service resources and proxies
Sometimes it is useful for a service to let clients refer to resources
allocated on their behalf. The resource lives with the service provider,
and the client receives a handle to it. The system will then take care
of cleaning up the resource when the client goes away.

Say, the provider can allocate a `Die` resource that the client can
interact with, by calling `roll` on it. Let's assume, that the
object must live on the provider. The provider gives the client
a way to create the object, and then sends a "handle" to the client.
Handles are simply integers, and the service is thus changed as follows:

<!-- CODE FILENAME service2.toit -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE import system.services show ServiceSelector -->
```
interface RandomGeneratorService:
  ...
  create-die -> int
  static CREATE-DIE-INDEX /int ::= 2

  roll-die handle/int -> int
  static ROLL-DIE-INDEX /int ::= 3
```
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   static SELECTOR ::= ServiceSelector -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE     --uuid="dd9e5fd1-a5e9-464e-b2ef-92bf15ea02ca" -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE     --major=0 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE     --minor=1 -->

The `Die`'s `roll` method is integrated into the service interface,
but the provider and client should abstract them away and move them
onto the resource objects.

### Resources on the provider
On the provider side a resource object should extend the `ServiceResource`
base class:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import .service2 -->
```
import system.services show ServiceResource ServiceProvider

class DieResource extends ServiceResource:
  sides_/int ::= ?

  constructor .sides_ provider/ServiceProvider client/int:
    super provider client

  roll -> int:
    return 1 + (random sides_)

  on-closed -> none:
    // Handle cleanup.
```

The `on-closed` method is automatically called when the client closes
the resource or if the client happens to go away. Instances of
`ServiceResource` are automatically serializable, so it is possible to
return them from the `handle` method in the service provider and
the `ServiceResource` constructor takes care of registering them
correctly, so they can be found later on future client method calls.

Let's add the new methods to the `RandomGeneratorServiceProvider`:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE class RandomGeneratorServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   constructor: super "test/random" --major=7 --minor=9 -->
```
  handle index/int arguments/any --gid/int --client/int -> any:
    ...
    if index == RandomGeneratorService.CREATE-DIE-INDEX:
      // The 'arguments' parameter is equal to the number of sides.
      return DieResource arguments this client

    if index == RandomGeneratorService.ROLL-DIE-INDEX:
      // The 'arguments' parameter is set to the handle of the resource.
      die := (resource client arguments) as DieResource
      return die.roll
```
<!-- HIDDEN CODE     return null -->

Note that we implement the `create-die` and `roll-die` functionality
directly in the `handle` method. That's not necessary, but often
convenient if it's as simple as in this case.

The provider also handles the `ROLL-DIE-INDEX` method by forwarding it to
the corresponding `DieResource` instance.

### Resources on the client
Clients receive resources as integers, representing the handle to the
resource. They need to convert the handle to a resource proxy that
can be used to call methods on the resource.

There is currently nothing in the service interface that defines how
the proxy should look like. It's up to the implementation to
create a good API for it.

A proxy should always extend
the `ServiceResourceProxy` base class, which automatically closes
the resources if it is garbage-collected:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import system.services show ServiceClient ServiceSelector -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE import .service2 -->
```
import system.services show ServiceResourceProxy

class DieProxy extends ServiceResourceProxy:
  constructor client/ServiceClient handle/int:
    super client handle

  roll -> int:
    return (client_ as RandomGeneratorServiceClient).roll-die_ handle_
```

The proxy takes the corresponding client and handle as arguments. As can be
seen, a handle is serialized as an `int`, but for the most part this can
be ignored.

The proxy simply forwards its 'roll' method to the client which needs to
add `create-die` and `roll-die_` methods:

```
class RandomGeneratorServiceClient extends ServiceClient:
  ...
  create-die sides/int -> DieProxy:
    handle := invoke_ RandomGeneratorService.CREATE-DIE-INDEX sides
    proxy := DieProxy this handle
    return proxy

  roll-die_ handle/int -> int:
    return invoke_ RandomGeneratorService.ROLL-DIE-INDEX handle
```
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   constructor: super RandomGeneratorService.SELECTOR -->

### Using a resource
With all that machinery in place, we can now use create resources through
our client and call methods on them:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import .service2 -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class RandomGeneratorServiceProvider: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   install: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class RandomGeneratorServiceClient: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   open: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   create-die sides: return null -->
<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
```
main:
  spawn::
    service := RandomGeneratorServiceProvider
    service.install

  client := RandomGeneratorServiceClient
  client.open
  die := client.create-die 6
  10.repeat:
    print "die roll = $(die.roll)"
  die.close
```

### Resource notifications
While most interactions with resources follow a simple request-response
pattern, it can be useful to be able to asynchronously notify users of
a resource of certain events. The `ServiceResource` and
`ServiceResourceProxy` classes have built-in support for this through
notifications. A notification is any kind of serializable object sent
from the resource to the proxy. The resources that take part in this
must be marked notifiable at construction time:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import system.services show ServiceResource ServiceProvider -->
```
class DieResource extends ServiceResource:
  ...
  constructor .sides_ provider/ServiceProvider client/int:
    super provider client --notifiable
  ...
```
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   on-closed: -->
<!-- HIDDEN CODE   sides_ := ? -->

Even though you probably wouldn't expect dice to ping you periodically, we can
now experiment with the behavior by adding periodic notifications like this:

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import system.services show ServiceResource ServiceProvider -->
```
class DieResource extends ServiceResource:
  sides_/int ::= ?
  task_ := null

  constructor .sides_ provider/ServiceProvider client/int:
    super provider client --notifiable
    task_ = task:: notify-periodically

  roll -> int:
    return random sides_

  notify-periodically -> none:
    while not Task.current.is-canceled:
      sleep --ms=(random 500) + 500
      notify_ 87

  on-closed -> none:
    task_.cancel
```

The notifications will show up on the proxy side through calls to `on-notified_`:
<!-- HIDDEN CODE class ServiceResourceProxy: -->
```
class DieProxy extends ServiceResourceProxy:
  ...
  on-notified_ notification/any -> none:
    print "got notified: $notification"
  ...
```

You'll need to wait a bit in `main` for the notifications to start showing up:
<!-- SKIP CODE -->
```
main:
  ...
  die := client.create-die 6
  10.repeat:
    print "die roll = $(die.roll)"
  sleep (Duration --s=10)
  die.close
```

## Example: Network by proxy

We have used the service framework to allow providing a full network
implementation from a separate container. The core of this is the
`NetworkService` interface and the associated `NetworkServiceClient`:

https://github.com/toitlang/toit/blob/master/lib/system/api/network.toit

We use them to build proxying sockets like `SocketResourceProxy_`
that forward reads and writes to the network service:

<!-- SKIP CODE -->
```
class SocketResourceProxy_ extends ServiceResourceProxy:
  static WRITE-DATA-SIZE-MAX_ /int ::= 2048
  ...
  write data from=0 to=data.size -> int:
    to = min to (from + WRITE-DATA-SIZE-MAX_)
    return (client_ as NetworkServiceClient).socket-write handle_ data[from..to]
  ...
```

You can find all the helpers in the main repository:

https://github.com/toitlang/toit/blob/master/lib/system/base/network.toit

All in all, this allows a cellular driver to provide a network to all other
apps that a blissfully unaware that their data flows through a good
old-fashioned sequence of
[AT commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayes_command_set).
