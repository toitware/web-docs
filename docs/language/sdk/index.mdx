# SDK

The Toit SDK is the set of development tools needed to develop IoT apps with Toit locally: it contains the Toit compiler, the LSP server and virtual machine.

The Toit SDK is available via the Toit cloud, and will be automatically downloaded to your computer the first time you use one of the Toit CLI commands that requires the Toit SDK to be present locally.

You can browse the current Toit standard libraries [here](https://libs.toit.io).

## SDK libraries

You can download the Toit library implementation of the core libraries for the latest SDK.

Choose between [ZIP](https://archive.toit.io/sdk/latest/lib/windows) or [TGZ](https://archive.toit.io/sdk/latest/lib/linux).
