# Font basics

This section explains how fonts work when using displays on the Toit SDK.

## Introduction

There is a selection of freely usable fonts available in packages.

The fonts are in the form of bitmaps, rather than scalable fonts. For some
fonts that were originally scalable, a selection of pixel sizes have been created ahead of time.
They can be displayed in any of 4 orientations. Most of the fonts are
variable-width, but there are also some typewriter-style fixed-width fonts.

In order to save space on the device, you must select which blocks of glyphs
(letters) you require for each font you are using. This will depend on the
languages you wish to support on the display, and which special characters you
need. For English language text it will be enough to include the `ASCII` block.
For the accented characters used in Western Europe you will need to add the
`LATIN-1-SUPPLEMENT` block. See the full list of blocks at
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_block). Toit packages use
a capitalized version of the official names of the blocks, replacing spaces
and dashes with undercores. The exception is the "Basic Latin" block, which
is called `ASCII`. Not all blocks are available in every font.

Right-to-Left writing systems and Abugida writing systems are not currently
suported.

<Note>

The Toit font display code does not support composable accents, and
so the characters in the text must be precomposed. Thus the 4-character sequence,
"A", "h", "e", acute-accent, cannot be displayed, whereas the 3-character
sequence "A", "h", "é" will display if the correct Unicode block is included in
the font.

</Note>

## Example

In the following example we assume the `font-x11-adobe` package has
been installed in your project.

<!-- HIDDEN CODE import pixel-display show TwoColorPixelDisplay -->
```
// Import the font and size that you need, and give it a name.
import font-x11-adobe.sans-14-bold as s14b

// Other imports we need.
import font show Font

// Select the Unicode blocks you need from the font. In this
// case we have the coverage needed for Western Europe, plus
// the Euro sign, which is in the CURRENCY-SYMBOLS block. We
// call our subset of the font sans-10-bold.
sans-14-bold ::= Font [s14b.ASCII, s14b.LATIN-1-SUPPLEMENT, s14b.CURRENCY-SYMBOLS]

// For this example we assume there exists a function `get-display` that
// creates a TwoColorPixelDisplay.
display ::= get-display

// Create a graphics context that uses this font. Whenever we
// add a text texture to a display using this context, the given
// font will be used.
context := display.context --landscape --font=sans-14-bold

// An example function that adds a text to a display.
my-fish-adding-function:

  // Add the fish text to the display at coordinates (50, 50).
  display.text context 50 50 "Ål, 3€/kg"

  // Update the display with the latest addition.
  display.draw
```
<!-- HIDDEN CODE get-display -> TwoColorPixelDisplay?: return null -->


## Available Fonts

The fonts are arranged according to their origin.

### Fonts from X11

These are taken from the X11 Windowing system commonly used with
Linux. They have been hand-optimized for low-resolution screens
and are suitable for use cases where individual pixels are visible
to the naked eye.

#### sans

This font is from the `font-x11-adobe` package.  It is a modified
version of the Adobe font named "Helvetica".  "Helvetica" is a trademark
of Monotype Imaging Inc.

A clean sans-serif variable-width font,
available in sizes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The styles are default,
oblique, bold and bold-oblique. For example the default style is found
with `import font-x11-adobe.sans-14` and the bold style can be
found with `import font-x11-adobe.sans-14-bold`. Coverage includes
mainly Latin letters, including accented variants.

version of the Adobe font named "New Century Schoolbook".
"New Century Schoolbook" is a trademark of Monotype GmbH.

A serif variable-width font,
available in sizes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The styles are default,

found with `import font-x11-adobe.book-14-bold`. Coverage includes
mainly Latin letters, including accented variants.
See the [copyright message](../adobe_copyright).

#### serif

This font is from the `font-x11-adobe` package.  It is a modified

available in sizes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The styles are default,
italic, bold and bold-italic. For example the default style is found
with `import font-x11-adobe.serif-14` and the bold style can be
found with `import font-x11-adobe.serif-14-bold`. Coverage includes
mainly Latin and Greek letters, including accented variants.
See the [copyright message](../adobe_copyright).

#### typewriter

This font is from the `font-x11-adobe` package.  It is a modified
version of the Adobe font named "Courier".

A serif fixed-width font,
available in sizes 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The styles are default,
oblique, bold and bold-oblique. For example the default style is found
with `import font-x11-adobe.typewriter-14` and the bold style can be
found with `import font-x11-adobe.typewriter-14-bold`. Coverage includes

#### clear

This font is from the `font-clear` package.  It is a modified
version of the Bigelow and Holmes font named "Lucida Bright".
"Lucida" is a trademark of Bigelow and Holmes, Inc.

A serif variable-width font,
available in sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19, and 24. The styles are default,
italic, bold and bold-italic. For example the default style is found
with `import font-clear.clear-14` and the bold style can be

#### clear-sans

This font is from the `font-clear` package.  It is a modified
version of the Bigelow and Holmes font named "Lucida Sans".
"Lucida" is a trademark of Bigelow and Holmes, Inc.

A sans-serif variable-width font,
available in sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 19, and 24. The styles are default,
italic, bold and bold-italic. For example the default style is found

See the [copyright message](../bigelow_and_holmes_copyright).

#### Clearly-U

This font is from the `font-clearly-u` package.

A sans-serif variable-width font,
available only in size 12. The styles are default and autobold, where
the autobold variant has been generated automatically by Toit, so it
can be a little crude-looking.
For example the default style is found
with `import font-clearly-u.clearly-u-12` and the bold style can be
found with `import font-clearly-u.clearly-u-12-autobold`.
It has
good coverage of left-to-right alphabets, including Roman, Greek, Cyrillic,
Armenian, Georgian, Ge'ez (Ethiopic), Cherokee, Unified Canadian Aboriginal,
Runes, and Braille. It also has some symbols, arrows and geometric shapes.

### Matthew Welch

The font designer Matthew Welch has designed some freely available fonts,
one of which we have chosen for inclusion.

#### tiny

This font is from the `font-tiny` package.

The tiny font has a normal height of only 4 pixels, plus one pixel for
descenders. Toit also provides a modified version of this font to
expand digits into the
descender area, which makes them 5 pixels high, and slightly more readable.
It covers only the ASCII area and so has no accented or non-English
characters. Use with `import font-tiny.tiny` or
`import font-tiny.tiny-bigger-digits`.
See the [copyright message](../matthew_welch_copyright).

### Google

The fonts in the Google Fonts project are distributed as TrueType
scalable fonts. We have converted one of them to our bitmap format.
Some refinements, for example kerning of individual letter pairs,
are not feasible to implement in a small platform, and have not
been included in the version available here.

#### Roboto

This font is from the `roboto` package.

This is a scalable sans-serif font used on Android phones among other places.
The bitmap versions here have been automatically generated, and
can be a little rough around the edges, especially on low resolution
displays. They are available in larger sizes than the hand-optimized
bitmap fonts. The styles are thin, light, regular, medium, bold, and black.
Each style is also available in an italic variant. Sizes are 10,
11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, and 36.
For example the regular style is found
with `import roboto.roboto-14-regular` and the italic style can be
found with `import roboto.roboto-14-regular_italic`.
Roboto has good coverage of Roman, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets.
