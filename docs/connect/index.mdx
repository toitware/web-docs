# Connect your hardware

Before your hardware can be claimed into your organization in the Toit console, it needs to be initially provisioned.

This means that the hardware is being granted a hardware ID used for the remaining of its lifecycle, and the latest released Toit firmware will be installed on the hardware.

## Types of hardware

Toit runs on the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a> chip from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price/performance out of all the MCUs. 
The ESP32 has 520 kB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for e.g. communication protocols (SPI, I2C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, and much more. Its deep-sleep mode allows for extremely low power usage, making it possible to run with two AA batteries for years.

If you don't have an ESP32 yet, you can buy one [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990).

## What you need

- An ESP32 board

- USB cable - USB A / micro USB B

- A computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

- A Toit account

- The Toit CLI installed on your computer

## ESP32 prerequisites


In order to install Toit on an ESP32 microcontroller, it must include at least 4MB of flash and support the following features:


- WiFi to enable the initial connection to the Toit cloud
  

- UART to transmit and receive serial data


<Note type="warning">The ESP32 cannot connect to 5GHz WiFi network.</Note>
