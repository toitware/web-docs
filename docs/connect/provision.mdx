# Provision your hardware

If you don't have an ESP32 yet, you can buy one <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990" target="_blank">here</a>.

You need the Toit CLI to complete the provisioning steps below, so if you haven't installed Toit on your computer, follow the steps described [here](../installation/toitcli).

## Provision

Follow the steps to initially provision your device:

- Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer where the Toit CLI is installed.

<Note type="warning" title="Drivers for macOS">
If you are using macOS, you might need to update the drivers from <a href="https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/" target="_blank">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers" target="_blank">here</a>. Install both drivers, reboot your computer and try to run the Toit CLI serial commands again.
</Note>

- Use the Toit CLI command to provision your device with initial settings and the latest released Toit firmware. Replace `SSID` and `WiFi-password` with your own WiFi credentials in the command:

  ```shell
  toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid=<SSID> -p wifi.password=<WiFi-password>
  ```

- The WiFi settings can be changed later on.

- The provision process might take up to 5 minutes. When finished the output of the `provision` command will look like this:

```

- The device is now provisioned and ready to be [claimed](/claim) in the Toit console.

<Note title="Troubleshooting">
If you have trouble connecting your ESP32 via a serial port to your computer, have a look in the section about [serial port troubleshooting](/serialport) for help.
Some hardware models need physical interaction with the device during flashing (like pushing a button). If flashing doesn't work, consult the documentation for your device.
</Note>

## Device model

The `provision` command sets the model on the device. The default model is `esp32-4mb`.

If you want to use another device model, you can provide it with `-m` in the provision command:

```shell
toit serial provision -m <model> -p wifi.ssid=<SSID> -p wifi.password=<WiFi-password>
```

Look for available device models for each firmware version available in the <a href="https://console.toit.io/organization/firmware" target="_blank">Toit console</a>.

<Note title="Problems with provision">
    
If the initial device provision fails during the provisioning steps, the hardware ID (if any) is written to the local disk if possible and will be reused the next time the command is executed on the same computer.

Also, if the provision command fails, consider trying with a lower baud rate (here half the default baud rate):

```shell
toit serial provision --baud 460800 -p wifi.ssid=<SSID> -p wifi.password=<WiFi-password>
```
