# SPI

[SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) is a serial communication bus able to address multiple devices along a main 3-wire bus with an additional 1 wire per device.

Toit exposes the peripheral through the `serial.protocols.spi` library.

```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.spi as spi

main:
  bus := spi.Bus
    --miso=gpio.Pin 12
    --mosi=gpio.Pin 13
    --clock=gpio.Pin 14
```

When communicating with a device, a unique chip-select Pin is used to signal when the chip in question is addressed. In addition, it's important to not select a device frequency that exceeds the capabilities of device. The maximum frequency can be found in the datasheet for the selected peripheral.

In case of the Bosh [BME280 sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/7/3/b/1/BME280_Datasheet.pdf), the maximum frequency is 10Mhz:

```
  bus := spi.Bus
    --miso=gpio.Pin 12
    --mosi=gpio.Pin 13
    --clock=gpio.Pin 14

  device := bus.device
    --cs=gpio.Pin 15
    --frequency=10_000_000
```
