# ESP32 reference guide

Toit runs on the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a> chip from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price/performance out of all the MCUs. 
The ESP32 has 520 KB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for e.g. communication protocols (SPI, I2C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, and much more. Its deep-sleep mode allows for extremely low power usage, making it possible to run with two AA batteries for years.

## Prerequisites

In order to install Toit on your ESP32, the device should include 4MB of ROM and support the following features:

- WiFi to enable the initial connection to the Toit cloud
  
- UART to transmit and receive serial data
