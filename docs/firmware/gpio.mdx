# GPIO

General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins are the foundation of working with any peripherals.

In Toit, the GPIO Pin class is exposed by the [`gpio` module](https://libs.toit.io/gpio/library-summary).

GPIO pins are managed across the device. That means that only one instance of a given GPIO pin can
exist at any given point in time. This ensures that two applications can't configure or use a
specific GPIO pin at the same time. The pin can be released again by calling `close` after usage:

```
import gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 21  // Acquired system-wide.
  // ...
  pin.close           // Released, can be used by other applications now.
```

<Note>

When an application terminates, the pin will automatically be closed and released.

## Output mode

If a GPIO pin is configured for `output` mode, `Pin.set` can be used to either drive the pin voltage high (1) or low (0).


  *Set value* | *Effect*
  --- | ---
  `0` | Low voltage
  `1` | High voltage

To configure a GPIO pin in output mode, either do it initially:
```
  output_pin := gpio.Pin 21 --output // Initialized for output mode.
```
or later (independent of previous mode):
```
  pin.config --output         // Reconfigure for output mode.
```

### Open-drain

GPIO pins also supports output mode as [open-drain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector). To configure the GPIO Pin as open-drain output do the following:

```
  pin.config --output --open_drain
```

In open-drain output mode, when setting the pin high, the pin will go into open-drain mode. That means the pin is not being pulled in any direction (floating).


  *Set value* | *Effect*
  --- | ---
  `0` | Low voltage
  `1` | Open drain

This can be useful when an external pull-up is connected to the pin.

## Input mode

The GPIO input mode can be used to read the state of a pin. This can be done by calling `Pin.get`, returning either 0 or 1 depending on the voltage measured at the pin.

To configure a GPIO pin in input mode, either do it initially:
```
  input_pin := gpio.Pin 21 --input // Initialized for input mode.
```
or later (independent of previous mode):
```
  pin.config --input         // Reconfigure for input mode.
```

### Waiting for state change

While `Pin.get` can be used to get the current Pin state, sometimes it's useful to block and wait until the pin changes state.
That can be done using the `Pin.wait_for` method.

```
import gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 21 --input
  pin.wait_for 1  // Wait for pin to be high.
```

### Pull-up and pull-down resistors

Some chips supports internal pull-up and/or pull-down resistors. While the size of the resistor depends on the chip
used, it can be enabled like this:

```
  pulled_up_pin := gpio.Pin 21 --input --pull_up
```

<Note>

If a Pin is configured as input with pull-up/pull-down, it automatically disables the pull-up/pull-down if it is reconfigured to output mode - and enables it again when reconfigured back to input.
