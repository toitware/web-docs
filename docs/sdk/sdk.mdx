# Toit SDK and firmware

The Toit SDK is the set of development tools needed to develop IoT apps with Toit locally: it contains the Toit compiler, the LSP server and virtual machine. It is available from the Toit cloud. When installing the Toit SDK on your computer, you can compile Toit programs locally. 

Firmware is the Toit runtime system you want to install on a device to enable program execution.
Devices connect occasionally to the Toit console for firmware updates and new applications to be installed.
A specific SDK version targets the same firmware version.

You can browse the current Toit standard libraries [here](https://libs.toit.io). You can also download the current or previous versions of the SDK examples and libraries from the [Download](https://console.toit.io/download) page in the console.
