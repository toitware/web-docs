# Device management

## Overview

This tab shows more detailed device information. A device is identified by 3 different identifiers: a hardware ID created during initial provisioning of the hardware, a device ID assigned when the hardware is claimed to your project, and the device name.
This section also lists the model of the hardware, and the firmware version currently installed on the device.

**Current issues** lists the unresolved issues about the device encountered by the Toit cloud.

**Most recent check-ins** visualizes as green squares the successful recent connections of the device with the Toit cloud.
A missed check-in is represented by a red square.

- The **Used storage graph** shows how much data (such as logs, metrics, app data and PubSub messages) is saved on the device while in deep sleep.
  Data is flushed to the console every time the device comes online. This happens as often as it is configured by the max offline parameter, but can also happen sooner if the flash drive capacity reaches a user-defined threshold of stored events.
  The latter situation is needed to prevent a loss of data due to a full flash drive.
  If the Used storage graph shows that your device often reaches high levels of storage, thereby requiring the device to come online too frequently, it is recommended to reduce the amount of data stored by the apps running on the device, or to filter more restrictively the logs and metrics saved on the device (see the Configuration | Advanced section below).

- The **Signal strength** graph depicts WiFi (and Cellular when relevant) signal strength during the successive check-ins of the device.

Several icons and messages near the device name summarize the device's activities, past or scheduled.

- A warning sign next to the name of the device means that the firmware installed on the device is no longer available in the console and needs to be updated.

- An update icon means that a firmware update is scheduled for the next time the device will come online. A double arrow indicates that a configuration update is scheduled.

- Last seen and Next check-in displays the date and time when the device was last online, and when it is expected to come online next based on its Max offline configuration. A past date for the Next check-in value indicates that a previous scheduled check-in event failed.

## Logs

This tab lists all logs for the selected device, from the moment it was provisioned the first time to the latest apps that ran on the device.
It is possible to filter the logs to only show the ones pertaining to a specific app ID.
You can also choose whether to show only application logs or system logs.

For each log, you can access the following information:

- **Message** lists predefined messages. For system logs, messages indicate when a device was initially claimed, or why a device was rebooted. When running an app, messages state the name of the app; subsequent messages for this app are defined in the Toit program. Messages can also be error messages for apps that failed to compile.

- **Created** gives the date and time of any logged event, seen as date and time for most events, or as a timer for actions that happened less than a minute ago.

- **Type** of the log event. It can be boot / process start / process stop / message.

- **App** lists the name of the app that generated the log.

## Apps

This tab lists active apps (filled cloud icon) or all apps (white cloud icon).

App installation status is color-coded to the left hand side of each row in the table. The color is green if the app installed or uninstalled properly, blue if it is in the process of installing or uninstalling, and red if the app needs your attention. For example, when upgrading your device's firmware version, some installed apps' status may become red because of incompatibility between firmware versions. In this case, a small warning icon will be added next to the firmware version in the table. These apps must be re-deployed to fix the issue.

- **App** lists the name of the program (as defined in the program) and a unique app ID. This number allows users to distinguish the different instances where the same program was run (they share the same app name, but will be assigned different app ID).

- **Program** shows the name of the Toit file used as entrypoint for the app.

- **Status** shows installation status.

- **Firmware** indicates the firmware version used when compiling the app during installation. A small warning icon indicates a mismatch between the version used to compile the app, and the version currently present on the device. This issue is usually resolved by re-deploying the app.
- **Created** gives the date and time the app was installed (seen as a timer if it was within the past hour).
- **Uninstall** This button can be used to uninstall the app from the device.

## Code

The code tab includes a terminal window where you can write a Toit program. Click on **Run on device** to run the program on the device.

<Note>

A program will automatically stop running after approximately 2 minutes, but you can also use the **Stop** button.

</Note>

## Configuration

This tab allows you to edit the configuration of your device.
The configuration changes will be applied to the device the next time it comes online and starts communicating with the Toit cloud.
A detailed description of the available device configurations can be viewed [here](../deviceconfig).

## Troubleshoot

This tab lists events that are generated each time a status change or config change is initiated, or a "next action" is sent from the console to the device, such as for example a command to the device to install an app, or a command for telling the device to upgrade firmware. This tab is particularly useful for troubleshooting devices by looking at all events in the system (device and console), including those that failed to complete.
