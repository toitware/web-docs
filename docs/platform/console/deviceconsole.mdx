# Devices management

Several icons and messages near the device name summarize the device's activities, past or scheduled.

<img src={ConsoleDevBox} alt="Toit console screenshot for a real device" />

* A warning sign next to the name of the device means that the firmware installed on the device is no longer available in the console and needs to be updated.
  
* An update icon means that a firmware update is scheduled for the next time the device will come online. A double arrow indicates that a configuration update is scheduled.
  
* Last seen and Next check-in displays the date and time when the device was last online, and when it is expected to come online next based on its Max offline configuration. A past date for the Next check-in value indicates that a previous scheduled check-in event failed.

## Overview

This tab allows you to see the device information. A device is identified by 3 different identifiers: a hardware ID created during initial provisioning of the device, a device ID assigned when the hardware is claimed by an organization, and the device name. This section also lists the model of the hardware, and the firmware version currently installed on the device.

**Current issues** lists the unresolved issues encountered by the device.

**Most recent check-ins** visualizes as green rectangles successful recent connections of the device with the console. A missed check-in is represented by a red rectangle.

* The **Used storage graph** shows how much data (such as logs, metrics, app data and PubSub messages) is saved on the device while in deep sleep.
Data is flushed to the console every time the device comes online. This happens as often as it is configured by the max offline parameter, but can also happen sooner if the flash drive capacity reaches a user-defined threshold of stored events.
The latter situation is needed to prevent a loss of data due to a full flash drive.
If the Used storage graph shows that your device often reaches high levels of storage, thereby requiring the device to come online too frequently, it is recommended to reduce the amount of data stored by the apps running on the device, or to filter more restrictively the logs and metrics saved on the device (see the Configuration | Advanced section below).

* The **Signal strength** graph depicts WiFi (and Cellular when relevant) signal strength during the successive check-ins of the device.

## Logs

This tab lists all logs for the selected device, from the moment it was claimed the first time to the latest apps that ran on the device.
It is possible to filter the logs to only show the ones pertaining to a specific app ID.
You can also choose whether to show or not the system logs.

For each log, you can access the following information:

* **Message** lists predefined messages. For system logs, messages indicate when a device was initially claimed, or why a device was rebooted. When running an app, messages state the name of the app; subsequent messages for this app are defined in the Toit program. Messages can also be error messages for apps that failed to compile.

* **Created** gives the date and time of any logged event, seen as date and time for most events, or as a timer for actions that happened less than a minute ago.

* **Type** of the log event. It can be boot / process start / process stop / message.

* **App** lists the name of the app that generated the log: for example "Run: temp.toit" for a log generated from an app called `temp.toit`, or "THP" for a log generated by an app called THP. It is set to "System" when the log refers to a system event.

## Apps

This tab lists only active apps (filled icon) or all apps (clear icon).

<img src={DeviceJobs} alt="Toit console screenshot showing installed jobs" />

Apps installation status is color-coded to the left hand side of the table. The color is green if the app installed or uninstalled properly, amber if it is in the process of installing or uninstalling, and red if the app needs your attention. For example, when upgrading your device's firmware version, some installed apps' status may become red because of incompatibility between SDK and firmware versions. In this case, a small warning icon will be added next to the firmware version in the table. These apps must be re-deployed to fix the issue.

* **App** lists the name of the program (as defined in the program) and a unique app ID. This number allows users to distinguish the different instances where the same program was run (they share the same app name, but will be assigned different app ID).

* **Program** shows the name of the Toit file used as entry point for the app.

* **Status** can be Installed, Uninstalled or Failed. Transition in status will be shown with Waiting to Install, or Waiting to Uninstall.

* **Firmware** indicates the firmware version used when compiling the app during installation. A small warning icon indicates a mismatch between the version used to compile the app, and the version currently present on the device. This issue is usually resolved by re-deploying the app.
  
* **Created** gives the date the app was installed (seen as a timer if it was within the past hour).
  
* **Uninstall** This icon can be used to uninstall apps.

## Code

The code tab includes a terminal window where you can write a Toit program. Click on **Run on device** to try it on the device.
<Note>
A program will automatically stop running after a certain amount of time, but you can also use the **Stop** button to that effect.
</Note>

## Configuration

This tab allows you to edit the configuration of your device. The changes in configuration will be applied to the device the next time it comes online and starts communicating with the console.

* **Firmware** The current version of the device firmware is shown here. To upgrade (or downgrade) the firmware on the device, click the Edit icon and choose a firmware version from the drop-down menu. Click Save.
The list of firmware versions in the drop-down menu contains only those firmware versions available for the given device model.
If the device is offline, the actual firmware upgrade/downgrade on the device will take place the next time the device gets online.

* **Max offline** configures how often the device is expected to be online, that is when it will connect to the Toit console, send data to the Toit console, install new firmware and/or new apps and apply new device configuration settings.
How frequent these connections are set to happen will influence the battery life of the device.
Change the 'Max offline' duration by clicking the Edit icon. Provide a value (2h, 10m, or 30s, for example) and click Save.
The changes will be applied the next time the device is online, or immediately if you reboot the device by taking the batteries out of the device for 90 seconds before reinserting them.
  
* **Connections** can be used to add or remove WiFi (and Cellular when relevant) connections. 
When two or more connections are present, choose the order in which they should be used by moving the connections to use in priority above the others. Click Save to add the new connection. Reboot the device if a new priority order needs to be taken into account.

* **Broker settings** lists host, port and common name.

* **Advanced** settings can adjust the quantity and quality of the logs accumulating on a device when it is offline.

    * By default, the **Used storage threshold** determines the storage capacity level at which a device will attempt to come online to flush data.

    * **Logging level** determines what kind of system logs should be sent to the console.
    It is set by default to INFO but can be edited to another level listed here in increasing order of specificity: PRINT (includes all other logs categories), DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL (which saves the least logs).

    * **Metrics level** determines what system metrics should be sent to the console.
    It is set by default to DEBUG (which saves all metrics) but can be refined to more specific levels such as INFO and CRITICAL (which saves the least metrics).

* **Unclaim device** Unclaiming a device means that the device no longer belongs to the organization where it was initially claimed.
To claim the device again, use the hardware ID of the device, which can be
obtained by running `toit serial info`.

## Troubleshoot

This tab lists events that are generated each time a status change or config change is initiated, or a "next action" is sent from the console to the device, such as for example a command to the device to install an app, or a command for telling the device to upgrade firmware. This tab is particularly useful for troubleshooting devices by looking at all events in the system (device and console), including those that failed to complete.
