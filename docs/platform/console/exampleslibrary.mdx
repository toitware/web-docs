# Examples, library and tools

Download example programs and the Toit SDK library for the latest released SDK from [here](../../../getstarted/download).

Or use the CLI to download examples and lib into a directory

```shell
toit sdk examples dir-name
```

and

```shell
toit sdk lib dir-name
```

where `dir-name` is replaced with the preferred directory name.

For example, download them in a `toit-examples` folder on your Desktop with

```shell
toit sdk examples ~/Desktop/toit-examples
```

## Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, open the folder with the downloaded SDK examples with **File | Open**.

For the SDK library folder, go to **File | Add Folder to Workspace...** and choose the downloaded library folder to access the Toit SDK library easily from the workspace where you write your Toit programs.

## Developer tools

### Shell auto completion for Toit

You can read a description of how to install shell auto-completion for macOS and Linux by typing the following command in your terminal:

    toit completion shell -h

where `shell` must be replaced with either `bash` or `zsh`.

Windows users can use [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) to use the Toit CLI auto completion feature.
