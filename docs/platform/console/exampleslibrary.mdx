# Examples, library and tools

Download example programs and the Toit SDK library for the latest released SDK from [here](../../../getstarted/download).

Or use the CLI to download examples and lib into a directory

```shell
toit sdk examples <dir-name>
```
and

```shell
toit sdk lib <dir-name>
```

For example, download them in a `toit-examples` folder on your Desktop with

```shell
toit sdk examples ~/Desktop/toit-examples
```

## Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, open the folder with the downloaded SDK examples with **File | Open**. 

For the SDK library folder, go to **File | Add Folder to Workspace...** and choose the downloaded library folder to access the Toit SDK library easily from the workspace where you write your Toit programs.

## Developer tools
