# Device fleet

You can organize your devices by renaming them so they share an identical prefix.

For example, devices with names

`Temp1`, `Temp2` and `Temp3`

are seen as a fleet of devices in the Toit CLI by using the
prefix `-p temp` as in:

```shell
toit fleet -p temp
```

Prefixes are case-insensitive.

## Update firmware on multiple devices

Update the firmware on several devices in one command with the Toit CLI command:

```shell
toit fleet -p name-prefix update
```

where `name-prefix` is replaced with the prefix.

## Deploy apps on multiple devices

Deploy a Toit app on several devices in one command:

```shell
toit fleet -p name-prefix deploy job.yaml
```

or deploy two Toit apps in one command with:

```shell
toit fleet -p name-prefix deploy job1.yaml job2.yaml
```
