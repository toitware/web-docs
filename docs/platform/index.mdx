The Toit platform combines the functionality of serving your devices in a robust, resilient way, and letting you have control over your devices and
your data, as well as ready-to-use over-the-air firmware and application updates on your network-connected embedded devices.

The platform takes care of the device life-cycle as well as the life-cycle of the applications that runs on your devices.
The platform also provides an overview of data usage, message subscriptions, logs, and connectivity settings of your devices.
