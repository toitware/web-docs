# Provisioning

Your ESP32 must be initially provisioned with the Toit firmware, before you can benefit from the Toit platform and all the features available.

Provisioning means that the ESP32 is being granted a unique hardware ID used for the remaining of its lifecycle,
and the latest released Toit firmware will be installed on the ESP32.

Your WiFi credentials are added in the provisioning step, letting your ESP32 get online and accessible from the Toit console. Additional connection settings can be added later on.

<Note>

Note that your computer does not need to be on the same WiFi network as your ESP32 in order to get your ESP32 online during initial provisioning.

## Provisioning steps

<Note type="warning" title="Install USB driver">

If you are using macOS or Windows, you might need to install or update the USB driver, if you have problems with the serial connection.

Follow the link to the USB driver [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

If you still have trouble connecting your ESP32 via a serial port to your computer, please visit the [troubleshoot](../../../support/troubleshoot) section.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

Provision your ESP32 using the [Web Serial interface](https://console.toit.io/serial) and follow the steps in the guide.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

Use the Toit CLI to provision your ESP32 with initial device settings and the latest released Toit firmware.
Replace `MY_SSID` and `my_password` with your own WiFi credentials in the following command:

```shell
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

<Note title="Pro-tip">

If you have not set a default serial port to use in the CLI, and there are multiple serial connections active on your computer, the `toit serial provision` command will prompt you to choose one of
the serial ports in order to continue the provision command using the correct port.

</Note>

The WiFi settings of your ESP32 can be changed later on.

The provision process might take up to 5 minutes.

When the ESP32 has been initially provisioned with WiFi credentials, the ESP32 device is connecting to the network via WiFi.
The serial connection is purely for debugging the device if WiFi connection is lost.
In other words, you can plug the ESP32 into another power source and communicate with the ESP32 over WiFi from now on.
Later on you can always add other connection types, like cellular connection.
