# Claiming

Toit devices must be claimed in order to be visible in the [Devices list](https://console.toit.io/devices) in the Toit console.

When a device has been claimed, it belongs to a Toit project. Only users that have access to the given Toit project can communicate with the device via the Toit cloud.

Usually, devices are claimed automatically as part of the initial [provisioning](../provision) step.
If the device wasn't able to connect via WiFi to the Toit cloud during provisioning, then the device needs to be claimed manually when the device can go online via WiFi.

## Get the hardware ID

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

Connect the ESP32 to a computer with a USB cable. It requires 3.3V voltage.

Open the [serial page](https://console.toit.io/serial) in the Toit console, and click the button to connect the ESP32 via the web serial interface.

If the ESP32 has been provisioned, the hardware ID is printed at the top of the page.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

Connect the ESP32 to a computer with a USB cable. It requires 3.3V voltage.

To get the hardware ID of your device, run the following Toit CLI command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit serial info -o yaml
```

The output confirms that the ESP32 is provisioned by printing its hardware ID:

```txt
hardware_id: 04d2027d-3ef8-436e-9716-3150f0b10733
model: esp32-4mb
name: 04d2027d-3ef8-436e-9716-3150f0b10733.611.2021-09-26.device.toitware.com
```

Note, that in cases where the ESP32 is unprovisioned, the command does not terminate.
Therefore, if the command takes more than 5 seconds to print the device's information, you must provision the device as explained in the [provisioning](../provision) section.

## Get ESP32 online

The ESP32 must be connected to the internet via WiFi before you can claim it into your Toit project. Start by ensuring that the correct WiFi credentials were provided during provisioning.

You can use the `Monitor` button in the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial) to verify whether the ESP32 tries to connect to the Toit console via WiFi.

If connection fails, add the correct WiFi credentials again using the `Reinstall` button.

Also, if the WiFi connection is unstable, the claim step might fail, so try to use another WiFi, if possible.

## Claim device

Manually claim the ESP32 into your Toit project by executing the following Toit CLI command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit device claim hardware-id
```

where you replace `hardware-id` with the actual hardware ID of your device. For example:

```shell
toit device claim 384a9843-cdb8-4dc6-970a-030fb8148068
```

You can also claim your device using the Claim button in the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial), if you have connected the device via a serial connection.

When claiming succeeds, the device can be viewed in the [list of devices](https://console.toit.io/devices).
