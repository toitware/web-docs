# Claiming

Toit devices must be claimed in order to be visible in the [Devices list](https://console.toit.io/devices) in the Toit console.

When a device has been claimed, it belongs to a Toit project. Only users that have access to the given Toit project can communicate with the device via the Toit cloud.

Usually, devices are claimed automatically as part of the initial [provisioning](../provision) step.
If the device wasn't able to connect via WiFi to the Toit cloud during provisioning, then the device needs to be claimed manually when the device is able to go online via WiFi.

## Get device online

The ESP32 must be connected to the internet via WiFi before you can claim it into your Toit project. Start by ensuring that the correct WiFi credentials were provided during the setup process.

You can use the `Monitor` button in the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial) to verify whether the ESP32 tries to connect to the Toit console via WiFi or whether it fails connecting.

If connection fails, add the correct WiFi credentials again using the `Reinstall` button.

Also, if the WiFi connection is unstable, the claim step might fail, so try to use another WiFi, if possible.

## Claim device

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

Manually claim the device into your Toit project by using the Toit console. Go to the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial), if you have connected the device via a serial connection,
and then press the `Ready` button. Choose the serial port that the ESP32 is connected to. When connected, press the `Claim` button in the upper right corner of the view.

</Tab>

<Tab label="CLI">

Manually claim the ESP32 into your Toit project by executing the following Toit CLI command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit device claim hardware-id
```

where you replace `hardware-id` with the actual hardware ID of your device. For example:

```shell
toit device claim 384a9843-cdb8-4dc6-970a-030fb8148068
```

You can get the hardware ID using the Toit CLI, by connecting the ESP32 to a computer with a USB cable, and execute the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
toit serial info -o yaml
```

The output confirms that the ESP32 is provisioned by printing its hardware ID:

```txt
hardware_id: 04d2027d-3ef8-436e-9716-3150f0b10733
model: esp32-4mb
name: 04d2027d-3ef8-436e-9716-3150f0b10733.611.2021-09-26.device.toitware.com
```

Copy the hardware ID and use it in the claim command above.

<Note type="info">

In the case where the ESP32 has not been provisioned with the Toit firmware, the `toit serial info` command does not terminate.
Therefore, if the command takes more than 5 seconds to print the device's information, you must provision the device as explained in the [provisioning](../provision) section.

When claiming succeeds, the device can be viewed in the [list of devices](https://console.toit.io/devices).
