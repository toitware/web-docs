# Provisioning

Your ESP32 must be initially installed with the Toit firmware, before you can benefit from the Toit platform and all the features available.
The initial installation is done with a cabled connection to the ESP32, usually USB.

Provisioning means that the Toit firmware will be installed on the ESP32, along with WiFi credentials allowing it to go online, connect to the Toit cloud, and receive
configuration updates, firmware updates, and app installations. In addition, the ESP32 is being granted a unique hardware identity used for the remaining of its lifecycle.

Additional connection settings can be added later on from the [Configuration tab](../deviceconfig/#connections) in the console.

Once the ESP32 is provisioned it will immediately go online and all subsequent communication with the ESP32 will be over-the-air.

<Note>

Note that your computer does not need to be on the same WiFi network as your ESP32 in order for it to go online during initial provisioning. During provisioning you simply supply your preferred WiFi credentials to the device, and it will subsequently use that WiFi to go online.

The ESP32 **cannot connect to 5GHz WiFi networks**. Use a 2.4GHz WiFi network instead when connecting.

## Provisioning steps

<Note type="warning" title="Install USB driver">

If you are using macOS or Windows, you might need to install or update the USB driver, if you have problems with the serial connection.

Follow the link to the USB driver [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

If you still have trouble connecting your ESP32 via a serial port to your computer, please visit the [troubleshoot](../../../support/troubleshoot) section.

<Tab label="Console">

Provision your ESP32 using the [Web Serial interface](https://console.toit.io/serial) and follow the steps in the guide.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

The Toit CLI can be used to provision your ESP32 with initial device settings and the latest released Toit firmware. The provision process might take up to 5 minutes.
Replace `MY_SSID` and `my_password` with your WiFi credentials using the following command:

```shell
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

<Note title="Pro-tip">

It is possible to get your device online using an unsecured WiFi by providing an empty password string to the `provision` CLI command.

</Note>

The WiFi settings of your ESP32 can be changed later from the [Configuration tab](../deviceconfig/#connections) in the console.

The serial connection is useful for debugging and reconfiguring the device if WiFi connection is lost.
