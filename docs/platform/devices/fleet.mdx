# Fleet management

You can organize your devices by renaming them so they share an identical prefix. For example, devices with names

`Temp1`, `Temp2` and `Temp3`

are seen as a fleet of devices in the Toit CLI by using the
prefix `-p temp` as in:

```shell
toit fleet -p temp
```

Prefixes are case-insensitive.

## Update firmware on multiple devices

Update the the Toit firmware on several devices in one command with the Toit CLI command:

```shell
toit fleet -p prefix update
```

where `prefix` is replaced with the device name prefix.

## Deploy apps on multiple devices

Deploy a Toit app on several devices in one command:

```shell
toit fleet -p prefix deploy job.yaml
```

or deploy two Toit apps on a fleet of devices in one command with:

```shell
toit fleet -p prefix deploy job1.yaml job2.yaml
```

where `prefix` is replaced with the device name prefix.

<Note type="info" title="Offline devices">

When updating the Toit firmware of a fleet of devices, or when deploying apps, the devices in the fleet do not need to be online.
The firmware update, or app deployment, will automatically begin the next time the devices go online.
