# Devices

An ESP32 microcontroller running Toit is referred to as a **device**. The process of installing the Toit firmware onto the ESP32 is referred to as [provisioning](./provision),
and a provisioned device can subsequently be [claimed](./claim) into a Toit project.

<Note>

Your device will be automatically claimed into your Toit project, both when provisioning a device using our [Web Serial interface](https://console.toit.io/serial) and when using the Toit CLI. 
Manually claiming a device is only necessary if you have an already provisioned device that you would like to claim into a Toit project.

</Note>

Once the device is claimed and online, one or more [apps](../apps) can be deployed onto the device. This can be done from the CLI, as well as by using the VSCode Toit extension.
Apps are installed and uninstalled run-time, over-the-air, and installation/uninstallation does not require reboots or resets.

A group of devices is often referred to as a [fleet](./fleet), and operations like app installations and [configuration changes](./deviceconfig) can be performed both on single devices or a fleet
consisting of many devices.

Once a device is no longer needed in a project, it can be unclaimed. Once unclaimed, the device can be claimed by other projects.
