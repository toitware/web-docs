# Data

The Toit cloud has it's own **publish/subscribe** technology that is inspired by [Google's PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview).

Data that is published by your IoT devices, is received by the Toit cloud, which then makes the data available for subscribing applications: being either a Toit application
running on another IoT device, or a third-party application.

The Toit cloud makes use of **subscriptions** and **topics** to achieve this asynchronous communication mechanism.

## Concepts

- **Topic**: A named resource to which messages are sent by publishers.

- **Subscription**: A named resource representing the stream of messages from a single, specific topic, to be delivered to the subscribing application.

- **Message**: The data that a publisher sends to a topic and is eventually delivered to subscribers.

- **Publisher**: An application that creates and sends messages to one or several topics.

- **Subscriber**: An application with a subscription to one or more topics to receive messages from it.

- **Acknowledgement**: A signal sent by a subscriber to PubSub after it has received a message successfully. Acked messages are removed from the subscription's message queue.
