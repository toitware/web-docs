# Run programs or deploy apps

With Toit, there are two ways to execute code on a device:

- **Running programs**

  Running a program means that the Toit code runs once on an online device. When the program has terminated, the program is removed from the device. This is useful for
  quickly testing a piece of code. Learn how to run your Toit program [here](./runprogram).

- **Deploying applications**

  Traditional microcontroller programming is usually based on an infinite main loop that implements all your logic. Toit offers a more flexible way of executing code,
  where a scheduled execution of your program is controlled by a separate specification file. These two files together form an app that can be deployed onto
  your device. Learn how to install your Toit app [here](./installingapp).

To get the best development experience we recommend to use Visual Studio Code with the Toit extension. See more [here](../../../getstarted/installation).
