# Communicate within a device

[PubSub](../../../../apis/pubsub) is a service for bi-directional
communication. In this tutorials, we show how PubSub enables communication between two apps installed on the **same device**. 

In this scenario, the
data does not need to be sent out to the cloud to be received by the other app.
We will be communicating on the device topic called `device:hello-world`.

## The subscriber

The subscriber sets up a subscription on a topic.

```
/// Subscribes to a device topic.

import pubsub
topic ::= "device:hello-world"

main:
  pubsub.subscribe topic: | msg/pubsub.Message |
    print "Received message '$msg.payload.to_string'"
    // Stop listening for other messages and exit 'main'.
    return
```

## The publisher

The publisher publishes the message `"Hello, World!"` on the topic and then terminates.

```
/// Publishes a message in the appropriate device topic.

import pubsub
topic ::= "device:hello-world"

main:
  pubsub.publish topic "Hello, World!"
```

## Running the example

Run the example with the CLI command

```shell
toit run subscribe.toit
```

on your default device. 

Once the program has started, open another terminal window and run

```shell
toit run publish.toit
```

The output of both commands are listed below:

```txt
$ toit run subscribe.toit
2020-06-12T09:11:49.689210Z: <process initiated>
Received message 'Hello, World!'
2020-08-04T10:45:46.397975Z: <process terminated - exit code: 0>
```

```txt
$ toit run publish.toit
2020-08-04T10:45:46.120857Z: <process initiated>
Hello, World!
2020-08-04T10:45:46.267676Z: <process terminated - exit code: 0>
[1]+  Done                    toit run subscribe.toit
```
