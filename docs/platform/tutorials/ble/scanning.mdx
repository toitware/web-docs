# Scanning

To start scanning for nearby devices, simply call `scan` on the `ble.Device`. The provided block will be called for each scan result:

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  device.scan: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    print "Found $remote_device"
```

Here the scan will run indefinitely.

## Collecting results

A scan can be used to create a list of remote devices that match a criteria, e.g. implement a specific service. A service is identified by a UUID with a select few services
being assigned by [Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/). As an example, the 16-bit UUID `0x190F` represents a battery service.

The following example shows how to scan for 3 seconds for the addresses of remote devices that implement a battery service.

```toit
import ble

BATTERY_SERVICE ::= ble.uuid 0x180F
SCAN_DURATION   ::= Duration --s=3

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  addresses := []

  device.scan --duration=SCAN_DURATION: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    if remote_device.data.service_classes.contains BATTERY_SERVICE:
      addresses.add remote_device.address

  print addresses
```
