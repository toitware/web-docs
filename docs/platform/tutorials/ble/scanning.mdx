# Scanning

To start scanning for nearby devices, simply call `scan` on the `ble.Device`. The provided block will be called for each scan result:

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  device.scan: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    print "Found $remote_device"
```

Here the scan will run indefinitely.

## Collecting results

Sometimes a scan is about finding a list of remote devices that matches a criteria, e.g. implementing a specific service. Services are expressed as UUIDs, with a select few
being defined by [Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/). As an example, the 16-bit UUID `0x190F` represent a battery service.

The following example shows how to scan for 3 seconds for remote devices implementing a battery service, collecting the addresses of the remote services.

```toit
import ble

BATTERY_SERVICE ::= ble.uuid 0x180F
SCAN_DURATION   ::= Duration --s=3

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  addresses := []

  device.scan --duration=SCAN_DURATION: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    if remote_service.service_classes.contains BATTERY_SERVICE:
      addresses.add remote_service.address

  print addresses
```
