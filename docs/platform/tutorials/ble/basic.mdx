# Basic

BLE stands for Bluetooth Low-Energy, a communication stack designed specifically for communication between IoT devices.

The stack builds on four simple, but powerful, concepts that can be combined to create a wide range of network topologies:

- **Advertising**: A BLE device can _advertise_ about itself. The advertisement can contain a list of *service*s and _manufactorer data_ section.

- **Scanning**: A BLE device can _scan_ nearby devices for advertisements.

- **Service**: A BLE service is composed by a list of characteristics, exposed by a BLE device as a _service_.

- **Characteristic**: A BLE service attribute containing a value that may be readable and writable from a _client_.
