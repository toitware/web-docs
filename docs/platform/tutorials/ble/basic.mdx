# Basic

BLE stands for Bluetooth Low-Energy, a communication stack designed specifically for communication between IoT devices.

The stack builds on a few simple, but powerful concepts that can be used together for a wide range of network topologies:

  * **Advertising**: A BLE device can *advertise* about itself. The advertisement can contain a list of *service*s and *manufactory data* section.
  * **Scanning**: A BLE device can *scan* nearby for advertisements.
  * **Service**: A BLE service is composed by a list of characteristics, exposed by a BLE device as a *server*.
  * **Characteristic**: A BLE service attribute containing a value, that may be readable and writable from a *client*.
