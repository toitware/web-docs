# Advertising

A device can advertise itself for other devices to see it. So in the base form, BLE advertising will just advertise the address of the BLE device.

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.start
```

## Name

Sometimes it can be beneficial to advertise the name of the device. That can be for debugging purposes or when a protocol requires it.

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  data := ble.AdvertisementData
    --name="Toit device"

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.set_data data
  advertiser.start
```

The name is included in all advertisements, so power and bandwidth is saved by omitting it.

## Service classes

To signal what services the device implements, service classes can be added to the advertisement data. Service classes are represented as UUIDs.

```toit
import ble

BATTERY_SERVICE ::= ble.uuid 0x180F

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  data := ble.AdvertisementData
    --service_classes=[BATTERY_SERVICE]

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.set_data data
  advertiser.start
```

<Note type="info">

In case the advertised UUIDs are 16 or 32-bit BLE uuids, the system will automatically report them as such.

</Note>

## Manufacturer data

The manufacturer data field is a custom payload that can be sent with _any_ advertisement (even though the name may suggest otherwise).

For example, the manufacturer data field can be used to periodically broadcast a sensor value, e.g. the temperature or the GPS location, to make it available to all nearby devices.

In the following example, the values between 0 and 255 are broadcasted incrementally with a new value every 5 seconds.

```toit
import ble

INTERVAL ::= Duration --s=5

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.start --interval=INTERVAL

  256.repeat:
    data := ble.AdvertisementData
      --manufacturer_data=#[it]
    advertiser.set_data data
    sleep INTERVAL
```
