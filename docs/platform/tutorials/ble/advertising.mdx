# Advertising

In the base form, advertising will just advertise the address of the device.

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.start
```

## Name

Sometimes it can be beneficial to advertise the name of the device. That can be for debugging purposes or when a protocol requires it.

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  data := ble.AdvertisementData
    --name="Toit device"

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.set_data data
  advertiser.start
```

The name is included in all advertisements, so power and bandwidth is saved by omitting it.

## Service classes

To signal what services the device implements, service classes can be added to the advertisement data. Service classes takes form of UUIDs.

```toit
import ble

BATTERY_SERVICE ::= ble.uuid 0x180F

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  data := ble.AdvertisementData
    --service_classes=[BATTERY_SERVICE]

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.set_data data
  advertiser.start
```

<Note type="info">

In case the advertised UUIDs are 16 or 32-bit BLE uuids, the system will automatically report them as such.

</Note>

## Manufacturer data

The manufacturer data field is a custom payload that can be sent with _any_ advertisement (even though the name may suggest otherwise).

An example of a use-case may be to periodically report a sensor value, that may be available to all; the local temperature or GPS location.

Here an incremental value from 0 to 255 is reported, once every 5 seconds.

```toit
import ble

INTERVAL ::= Duration --s=5

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  advertiser := device.advertise
  advertiser.start --interval=INTERVAL

  256.repeat:
    data := ble.AdvertisementData
      --manufacturer_data=#[it]
    advertiser.set_data data
    sleep INTERVAL
```
