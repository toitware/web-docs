# Cellular

The Toit firmware comes with built-in support for Cellular LTE-M/NB-IoT modems. They offer connectivity speeds from 26 kbit/s up to 4 Mbit/s, depending on modem and network of choice.
LTE-M/NB-IoT also offers great coverage and penetration, thus making it ideal for many IoT solutions.

Due to the way connectivity is designed in Toit, setting up Cellular requires two simple steps: configuring the hardware and configuring the connectivity options.

- **Configuring the hardware** is done by installing the Toit firmware with some model arguments.

- **Configuring the connection** can be done either when installing the Toit firmware or later in the Toit Console.

## Modems and Drivers

Currently supported modems are listed here.

| Modem           | Available since | Argument                      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Ublox Sara R4   | v1.0.0          | `-p model.cellular.sara.r4=1` |
| Ublox Sara R5   | v1.1.0          | `-p model.cellular.sara.r5=1` |
| Quectel BG96    | v1.2.0          | `-p model.cellular.bg96=1`    |
| Sequans Monarch | v1.2.0          | `-p model.cellular.monarch=1` |

The following [Toit CLI](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted/installation) command shows the cellular connection configuration parameters in the serial reinstall command. In this example, the Ublox Sara R4 modem is used:

```shell
toit serial reinstall \
  -p model.cellular.enabled=1 \
  -p model.cellular.sara.r4=1 \
  ...
```

(These model arguments are not yet supported in the Toit console, when flashing directly from the browser.  You must
use the command line tools for now.)

## `PWR` and `RESET`

When connecting power, most Cellular modems will not automatically boot. To boot the modem, the `PWR` pin of the modem must be triggered. Likewise, if something goes wrong, a `RESET` pin can be used to trigger a Cellular modem reset.

The Firmware knows how to _use_ these pins, but which pin to use is fully optional and thus needs to be configured:

```shell
toit serial reinstall \
  -p model.cellular.enabled=1 \
  -p model.cellular.pwr=17 \
  -p model.cellular.reset=16 \
  ...
```

The `PWR` pin is mandatory while the `RESET` pin is optional.

<Note type="info">

Some Cellular modules use alternative names for the `PWR` pin, such as `WAKE` and `POWER_ON`.

</Note>

## UART

Cellular modems are connected using UART. UART is a bi-directional stream with optional flow control. The base pins are called TX and RX, for Transmitting and Receiving, respectively.
Both the microcontroller and the Cellular modem have such pins, and must be connected as TX to RX and RX to TX, such that data _transmitted_ from one will be _received_ by the other.

<Note type="info">

Some Cellular modules show TX and RX as they should be connected directly by the microcontroller. If connection doesn't work, **try swapping RX and TX**.

</Note>

### Flow Control

UART also offers flow control, that will help Cellular modems to halt communication when the receiver is busy. They are called RTS and CTS,
and unlike TX and RX, they are _not_ cross connected. They work by pulling down RTS when the Cellular Modem can write, and likewise pulling down CTS when the microcontroller can write.

#### UART with Flow Control

This example shows how do a full setup for `PWR` and `RESET` lines (including flow control).

<img src={CellularUartFlowControl} alt="Cellular UART setup with RTS/CTS flow control" />

To configure the Toit firmware (to be installed on your hardware) as shown here, use the following parameters:

```shell
toit serial reinstall \
  -p model.cellular.enabled=1 \
  -p model.cellular.rx=23 \
  -p model.cellular.tx=22 \
  -p model.cellular.rts=19 \
  -p model.cellular.cts=18 \
  -p model.cellular.pwr=17 \
  -p model.cellular.reset=16 \
  ...
```

<Note type="info">

The selected pins are purely an example, select the GPIO pins that fit your design.

</Note>

#### UART without Flow Control

Most Cellular modems and microcontrollers can handle the throughput of the UART, and flow control can be skipped for some designs. To disable flow control,
pull RTS low on the Cellular modem and leave CTS unconnected.

This example shows how do a setup without flow control, with `PWR` and `RESET` lines.

<img src={CellularUartNoFlowControl} alt="Cellular UART setup without flow control" />

For the command, simply omit RTS and CTS:

```shell
toit serial reinstall \
  -p model.cellular.enabled=1 \
  -p model.cellular.rx=23 \
  -p model.cellular.tx=22 \
  -p model.cellular.pwr=17 \
  -p model.cellular.reset=16 \
  ...
```

## Configure Cellular Connection

While cellular always requires at least one setting, the APN, there are a few more for use in different regions around the world.

| Name     | Argument                     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| APN      | `-p cellular.apn=onomondo`   | The virtual network name that modem should connect to. This is provided by the Sim Card issuer, and is e.g. `onomondo` for Onomondo and `soracom.io` for Soracom. |
| Bands    | `-p cellular.bands=2,5,20`   | List of bands to search for. These are dependent on the region, e.g. EU, NA and Asia                                                                              |
| Operator | `-p cellular.operator=23801` | By default, the modem will search and connect to the best suited operator. However, this can be overridden and pinned to a single one, by using this command.     |

## Examples

### Pycom GPy

Toit can run on the [Pycom GPy](https://docs.pycom.io/datasheets/development/gpy/), with support for the Sequans Monarch cellular modem embedded into it.
As the GPy is fully embedded, the pin configuration is already pre-determined.

| Name | Pin |
| ---- | --- |
| TX   | 5   |
| RX   | 23  |
| RTS  | 19  |
| CTS  | 18  |
| WAKE | 27  |

The GPy can thus easily be enabled to run with a cellular stack. The following command shows how to install the Toit firmware configured to use the cellular stack with an Onomondo Sim Card.

```shell
toit serial reinstall \
  -p model.cellular.enabled=1 \
  -p model.cellular.tx=5 \
  -p model.cellular.rx=23 \
  -p model.cellular.rts=19 \
  -p model.cellular.cts=18 \
  -p model.cellular.pwr=27 \
  -p model.cellular.monarch=1 \
  -p cellular.apn=onomondo \
  --port=/dev/ttyACM0
```
