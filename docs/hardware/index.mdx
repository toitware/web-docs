# Overview

This section gives an overview of the hardware, communication protocols, how to connect external sensors with your ESP32, as well as the Toit firmware to be installed on your ESP32 - ready for use in your next IoT project.

Toit has made the hardware integration easy for you and implemented the protocols you might need.

You will learn how to work with [GPIO pins](peripherals/gpio), and the various [peripherals](peripherals) that the ESP32 supports,
and an example of how to [connect sensors](drivers/bme280) to the ESP32.

Toit supports two types of wireless connectivity: WiFi and Cellular.
The ESP32 has built-in WiFi, and with Toit the connection is easy to configure on the ESP32.
Study how to set up Cellular connectivity on the ESP32 [here](connectivity/cellular).
