# Overview

This section explains how to use your external peripherals together with your ESP32 - installed with the Toit firmware.

We have made the integration easy for you and implemented the protocols you might need.

You will learn how to work with [GPIO pins](drivers/gpio), and the various [protocols](drivers/protocols) that the ESP32 supports,
as well as how to [connect sensors](drivers/bme280) to your ESP32.

You can view the list of [available drivers](drivers/driverslist) - more is coming!
