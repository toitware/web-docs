# Overview

The ESP32 supports a wide range of protocols, many of them supported directly by Toit.

## Selecting the right protocol

Many chips support both SPI and I2C. While Toit makes it easy to develop drivers that are usable by both, there are some clear advantages and disadvantages between the two.

**I2C**

- Supports longer distances
- Only requires two wires

**SPI**

- Is significantly faster
- Frequency configurable per device, not the bus
