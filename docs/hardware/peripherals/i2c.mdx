# I2C

[I<sup>2</sup>C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) is a serial communication bus able to address multiple devices along the same 2-wire bus.

Toit exposes the peripheral through the `serial.protocols.i2c` library.

```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22
```

Each device must have a unique address. The address can be found in the datasheet for the selected peripheral - it's an 7-bit integer.

In case of the Bosch [BME280 sensor](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/e/7/3/b/1/BME280_Datasheet.pdf), the address is `0x76`:

```
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22

  device := bus.device 0x76
```

## Frequency

The default frequency of the I<sup>2</sup>C bus is 400kHz in Toit. This can be changed as an argument to the `i2c.Bus` at construction time with

```
  i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22
    --frequency=100000
```

Remember that when changing the frequency, the associated pull-up resistors may have to be changed as well.
