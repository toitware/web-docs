## Problems with WiFi connection

<details>
  <summary>Do you have problems getting your ESP32 online with WiFi?</summary>

<Tabs>
<Tab label="YES">

- The ESP32 cannot connect to 5GHz WiFi network, so be sure to use the WiFi that is on 2.4GHz.

- Make sure that you have typed the correct WiFi SSID and password in the provisioning step. If you are unsure, you can use the `Monitor` button in the
  [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/serial), and check the serial output of your ESP32 in order to see whether the device connects to the internet or fails trying.

- You can configure your device with the WiFi details again using the `Reinstall` button in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/serial).

- When your device can get online via WiFi (verify with the Monitor button), you must claim your device into your Toit project by using the `Claim` button on the [devices page](https://console.toit.io/devices). See detailed instructions [here](../claim).

## Problems with an unreachable device

  <summary>Do you have an unreachable device?</summary>

If your ESP32 is misconfigured in any way, for example if it does not have valid WiFi connection settings, reinstall the ESP32 with the Toit firmware
and WiFi settings via a serial connection, by connecting it with a USB cable to your computer.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

In the [Web Serial](https://console.toit.io/serial) page in the Toit console, press the Reinstall button and provide the WiFi credentials for the WiFi currently available.

</Tab>

<Tab label="CLI">

Run the `toit serial reinstall` CLI command
with the appropriate WiFi connection settings provided (replace `MY_SSID` and `my_password` with the correct WiFi credentials):

```shell
toit serial reinstall -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
This will reinstall the Toit firmware and settings via the serial port without changing its hardware certificate or hardware ID.
