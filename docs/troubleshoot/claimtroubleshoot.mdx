<Tab label="YES">

If your device was provisioned with the Toit firmware and WiFi settings, but the automatic claiming step failed. Try the following steps:

- Press the `Monitor` button in the [Web serial view](https://console.toit.io/serial) in the Toit console, to see whether the device is trying to connect to the Toit cloud with the WiFi credentials provided.

- If the device fails connecting via WiFi, you must reinstall the Toit firmware and WiFi settings in order to get your device online. Use the `Reinstall` button on the Web serial page.

- Use the `Monitor` button to make sure your device can get online. When it does, go to the Devices page, and click the `Claim` button, in order to claim the device into your Toit project.

- Copy the hardware ID from the Web serial page before claiming the device.

- If the manual claiming succeeds, your device will be visible in the [list of devices](https://console.toit.io/devices) in the Toit console.
