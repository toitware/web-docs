# Scanning

To start scanning and for nearby BLE devices, simply call `scan` on the `ble.Device`. The provided block will be called for each scan result:

```toit
import ble

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  device.scan: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    print "Found $remote_device"
```

Here the scan will run indefinitely.

## Collecting results

A scan can be used to create a list of remote devices that match a criteria, e.g. implement a specific service. A service is identified by a UUID with a select few services
being assigned by [Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/). As an example, the 16-bit UUID `0x180F` represents a battery service.

The following example shows how to scan for 3 seconds for the addresses of remote devices that implement a battery service.

```toit
import ble

BATTERY_SERVICE ::= ble.uuid 0x180F
SCAN_DURATION   ::= Duration --s=3

main:
  device := ble.Device.default

  addresses := []

  device.scan --duration=SCAN_DURATION: | remote_device/ble.RemoteDevice |
    if remote_device.data.service_classes.contains BATTERY_SERVICE:
      addresses.add remote_device.address

  print addresses
```

## Example: Mobile phone as a BLE device

If you want to discover and find your mobile phone as a BLE device using the above Toit program, you can
download a mobile app, like nRF Connect.

Download the app on your mobile phone for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nrf-connect-for-mobile/id1054362403) or for
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp&hl=en).

The nRF Connect app allows your iOS or Android device to advertise as a BLE peripheral,
as well as discovering nearby peripherals, like your Toit device.

When running the above Toit program for scanning, you will be able to see your mobile phone on the list of discovered BLE devices.
