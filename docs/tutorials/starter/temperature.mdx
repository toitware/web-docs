# Temperature, Humidity and Pressure

In this tutorial we are using an ESP32 with the Bocsh [BME280 sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme280-ds002.pdf); an environmental sensor measuring temperature, the relative humidity, and the atmospheric pressure.

This example illustrates the difference between running a Toit program once on an ESP32 and deploying the same code as an app together with a specification file.

## Run on an ESP32

To get data from the sensors, we make use of the [sensor driver](../../sensors/bme280) by importing it in the Toit program with `import drivers.bme280`.

We also need to specify the [GPIO pins](../../sensors/gpio) and the relevant [connection bus](../../sensors/protocols).

```
// Save this program in a file named thp.toit
import gpio
import serial.protocols.i2c as i2c
import drivers.bme280

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 21
    --scl=gpio.Pin 22

  device := bus.device 0x77

  bme := drivers.Bme280 device

  bme.on
  print "Temperature: $bme.read_temperature C"
  print "Humidity: $bme.read_humidity %"
  print "Pressure: $bme.read_pressure Pa"
  bme.off
```

 Save the above Toit program in a file named `thp.toit`.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

Copy and paste the program above into the Code tab of an online ESP32 with the
temperature sensor, press the **Run on device** button and go to the **Logs
tab** (or the Humio tab) of the device to see the logged temperature, humidity
and pressure from the ESP32.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

To run the program once on the ESP32, execute the CLI command

```shell
toit run thp.toit
```

If you haven't set your default device in the CLI, add `-d <device-name>` to
the run command, where `<device-name>` is the name of your ESP32.

```shell
$ toit run thp.toit
2021-04-14T13:09:04.801533Z: &lt;process initiated&gt;
Temperature is 23.1 C
Humidity is 29%
Atmospheric Pressure is 1006.0 Pa
2021-04-14T13:09:05.020756Z: &lt;process terminated - exit code: 0&gt;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Running a Toit program in this way means that it will be uninstalled from the device once the program has terminated.

## Deploy on an ESP32

We can use the same Toit program to repeatedly measure the temperature,
humidity, and pressure once every hour by deploying it on the ESP32 using the
following app specification file:

```yaml
# filename: thp.yaml

# This app specification file executes the 'Hourly THP' app on install
# and subsequently every hour.

name: Hourly THP
entrypoint: thp.toit
triggers:
    on_install: true
    on_interval: 1h
```

Save the content of the above yaml specification into a file named `thp.yaml`
located in the same directory as the `thp.toit` file from the [previous
step](#run-on-an-esp32).

Deploy the "Hourly THP" app on your ESP32 with the CLI command

```shell
toit deploy thp.yaml
```

If you haven't set your default device in the CLI, add `-d <device-name>` to
the deploy command, where `<device-name>` is the name of your ESP32.

The device log will show the three measurements every hour after the program
has been installed on the device.

Note that the device is not required to be online when the app is deployed.
When the device comes online, the app will be installed on the device and start
it's scheduled execution.

View all apps installed (or waiting to be installed) on your ESP32 from the
Apps tab

## Uninstall an app

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

To uninstall an app, click on the **Uninstall** button in the Apps tab of the device.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

To uninstall an app, run

```shell
toit device ps
```

to get the list of installed apps on your device.

Note the app ID or the app name, and replace it in the command:

```shell
toit device uninstall <app-ID or app-name>
```

For example,
```shell
toit device uninstall "Hourly THP"
```
