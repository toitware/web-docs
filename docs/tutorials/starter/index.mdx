# Log the date and time

In this tutorial we show you how to run a simple data-logging program on your device.
The program logs the current date and time, which can then be viewed in the Toit console or with the Toit CLI.

The following Toit program uses `print` to log the current date and time.

```
main:
  time := Time.now.local
  print "Time: $(%02d time.h):$(%02d time.m)"
  print "Date: $(%04d time.year)-$(%02d time.month)-$(%02d time.day)"
```

Save the above Toit program in a file named `time.toit`, and run the command

```shell
$ jag run time.toit
Running 'time.toit' on 'mydevice' ...
Success: Sent 37KB code to 'mydevice'
```

This runs the `time.toit` program on your default device. If you have
more than one device and haven't defined a default device yet, you can
use the `-d` option to specify on which device the program should run.

To see the output of the program you need to monitor the serial line, which
you can do in a different terminal window with the `jag monitor` command.

The output in the `jag monitor` will look like

```
[jaguar] INFO: program 7a3d83f9-837c-589d-a6e4-8f95ecb3cab4 started
Time: 00:00
Date: 1970-01-01
[jaguar] INFO: program 7a3d83f9-837c-589d-a6e4-8f95ecb3cab4 stopped
```

The reason you see this date from the 1970s is that the system time
has not been updated on your device yet.
[Here](https://github.com/toitlang/pkg-ntp/blob/master/examples/settime.toit)
is a small program that can be run after power-up to fix that.
