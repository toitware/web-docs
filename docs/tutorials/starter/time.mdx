# Log the date and time

In this tutorial we show you how to run a simple data-logging program on your device.
The program logs the current date and time, which can then be viewed in the Toit console or with the Toit CLI.

The following Toit program uses `print` to log the current date and time.

```
main:
  time := Time.now.local
  print "Time: $(%02d time.h):$(%02d time.m)"
  print "Date: $(%04d time.year)-$(%02d time.month)-$(%02d time.day)"
```

<Tab label="Console">

Copy and paste the Toit program above into the Code tab of an online device,
press the **Run on device** button and go to the Logs tab of
the device to see the logged date and time that is sent from the device to the
Toit console.

The **Logs** tab of your device shows the recent log entries. Check the
"Application" to filter out logs to only display the ones generated by Toit
applications.

Save the above Toit program in a file named `time.toit`, and run the command

```shell
toit run time.toit
```

The output is printed in the terminal window after program execution.

```shell
$ toit run time.toit
2021-04-15T08:48:41.308244Z: <process initiated>
Time: 10:48
Date: 2021-04-15
2021-04-15T08:48:41.685042Z: <process terminated - exit code: 0>
```

To view the recent device logs from 10 minutes ago and wait for future logs, run

```shell
toit device logs -f 10m
```

The output will look like this

```shell
$ toit device logs -f 10m
