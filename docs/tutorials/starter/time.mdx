# Log the time

In this tutorial we will show you how to get the current date and time of a
device, and how to view the logs from the device using either the Toit console
or the Toit CLI.

## Toit program for logging the time

The following Toit programs gets the date and time and prints them.

```
main:
  print Time.now
  time := Time.now.local
  print "Time: $(%02d time.h):$(%02d time.m)"
  print "Date: $(%04d time.year)-$(%02d time.month)-$(%02d time.day)"
```

<Tab label="Console">

Copy and paste the Toit program above into the Code tab of an online device,
press the **Run on device** button and go to the Logs tab (or the Humio tab) of
the device to see the logged date and time that is sent from the device to the
Toit console.

The **Logs** tab of your device shows the recent log entries. Check the
"Application" to filter out logs to only display the ones generated by Toit
applications.

Navigate to the **Humio** tab of the device to see the device logs using
[Humio's](https://www.humio.com/) log management
framework. Get familiar with Humio search queries
[here](https://docs.humio.com/reference/language-syntax/).

<Tab label="CLI">

Save the above Toit program in a file named `time.toit`, and run the command

```shell
toit run time.toit
```

The output is printed in the terminal window after program execution.

```shell
$ toit run time.toit

2021-04-15T08:48:41Z
Time: 10:48
Date: 2021-04-15
2021-04-15T08:48:41.685042Z: <process terminated - exit code: 0>
```

To view the recent device logs from 10 minutes ago and wait for future logs, run

```shell
toit device logs -f 10m
```

The output will look like this

```shell
$ toit device logs -f 10m
