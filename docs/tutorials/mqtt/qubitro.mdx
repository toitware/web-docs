# MQTT with Qubitro

[Qubitro](https://www.qubitro.com) is a device data platform with an MQTT endpoint.
The broker can be used freely for a limited number of devices.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

While not necessary, we recommend to do the [MQTT tutorial](..) first. Similarly,
you might want to read the [services](../../containers/services) tutorial.

## Packages
Instead of using the MQTT package directly, we are going to use the
[qubitro](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Fkasperl%2Ftoit-qubitro)
package. It provides a service-oriented interface to the Qubitro MQTT broker.

See the [packages](../../setup/packages) tutorial for details on how to
install packages.

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/kasperl/toit-qubitro@v0.4.0
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install qubitro`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the same package
as used in this tutorial.

</Note>

## Qubitro
To use Qubitro, you need to create an account. Roughly you have to do
the following:

- Go to [qubitro.com](https://qubitro.com):
- Get started -- it's free.
- Sign up.
- Complete the verification of your email.

Then create a new project with an MQTT source:

- In the "Projects" tab, click on "New Project" and create a new project.
- Click on the new project.
- Click on "New Source" and pick "MQTT".
- Fill in the data. All fields are required but can be changed later.
- Click on the device.
- Click on the "Connection details".
- Copy out the username and password. You will need them later.

## Code
Qubitro can be used like any other MQTT broker. However, in this tutorial we
are using the Qubitro package which encapsulates the MQTT client into a service
that can be accessed through RPC calls. This has the advantage that the
code is smaller, and that multiple different containers can use the same
client without needing to establish a new connection for each container.

Start a new Toit program `qubitro.toit` and add the following code:

``` toit
import qubitro
import qubitro.service

main:
  // Start the Qubitro service.
  service.main

  // Connect to the service and publish through it.
  client ::= qubitro.connect
  client.publish { "MyData": random 1000 }
```
Note that we haven't specified the username and password in the code. We are
providing it through Jaguar defines. Launch the program as follows:
``` shell
jag run \
    -Dqubitro.device.id=<YOUR-USER-NAME> \
    -Dqubitro.device.token=<YOUR-PASSWORD> \
    qubitro.toit
```

You should see a new value appear in the storage tab of the device.

<Note>

The `-D` flag only works for `run`, but not for `watch`. It is also not
supported for `-d host`. If you want to use Qubitro without an ESP32 device
you can either modify the `qubitro` package, or use the `mqtt` package directly.

</Note>

### Running the Qubitro service in a separate container
So far we have been running the Qubitro service in the same container as the
main program. However, it is possible to run the service in a separate container
and access it through RPC calls. This is useful if you have multiple containers
that need to access the same Qubitro client.

Create a new file `qubitro-service.toit` with the following code:

``` toit
import qubitro.service

main:
  // Start the Qubitro service.
  service.main
```

We can install the service as a container as follows:
``` shell
jag container install \
    -Dqubitro.device.id=<YOUR-USER-NAME> \
    -Dqubitro.device.token=<YOUR-PASSWORD> \
    qubitro qubitro-service.toit
```


At the same time we need to modify the `qubitro.toit` program to remove the
service start:

```
import qubitro

main:
  client ::= qubitro.connect
  client.publish { "MyData": random 1000 }
```

We can now run the program without needing the defines:
``` shell
jag run qubitro.toit
```
In fact, we can now `jag watch` the file and execute it as soon as we save it.

## Qubitro dashboards

One nice feature of Qubitro is the possibility to create dashboards that
visualize the published data. The following is just an example that uses
some values that were published while writing this tutorial:

<img
  src={QubitroDashboard}
  alt="Qubitro dashboard"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto;"
/>

You can follow Qbitro's [dashboard documentation](https://docs.qubitro.com/platform/dashboards)
if you want to create your own dashboard.
