# TCP (and TLS)

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) is an IoT friendly messaging protocol for publishing and subscribing to a shared MQTT broker from a wide range of devices.

This tutorial shows you how to connect to an MQTT broker using TCP (or TLS).

## Connect

The Toit MQTT client is available from the [`mqtt` package](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Fmqtt) - in the Toit package registry.

Install the package using the Toi CLI:

```shell
toit pkg install github.com/toitware/mqtt
```

and use it by importing it into your application with `import mqtt`.

MQTT requires every client to have a unique `CLIENT_ID`. That ID is sent when connecting to the broker, and identifies a session on the broker.
It is used to reliable transmit packets that require acknowlegments (QoS=1).

```toit
import net
import mqtt

// Include a random number, as we are sharing test.mosquitto.org with other users.
CLIENT_ID ::= "my-client-id-$(random)"
HOST      ::= "test.mosquitto.org"

main:
  network := net.open
  transport := mqtt.TcpTransport network --host=HOST
  client := mqtt.Client --transport=transport
  client.start --client_id=CLIENT_ID

  // Client is now connected.
```

Some brokers require the client to provide a `username` and `password`. These can be passed to the client during the
`start` call in an `options` object:

```
  options := mqtt.SessionOptions
      --client_id=CLIENT_ID
      --username=MY_USERNAME
      --password=MY_PASSWORD
  client.start --options=options
```
See the [documentation](https://pkg.toit.io/github.com/toitware/mqtt@2.0.1/docs/mqtt/library-summary) or
[examples](https://github.com/toitware/mqtt/tree/main/examples) of the MQTT library for more information.

## Publish

Simple sensor applications mainly have one purpose; to send sensor data. When sending data, you simply need to specify which topic to publish to, together with the payload.

A publish function could look similar to the following:

```toit
import mqtt
import encoding.json

TOPIC ::= "my/topic"

publish client/mqtt.Client value/float:
  payload := json.encode {
    "value": value
  }
  client.publish TOPIC payload

```

Note that the payload must be a byte array. If your data is a string, simply call `.to_byte_array` on it.

## Subscribe

Subscribing to data requires two informations: the topic (or filter) to subscribe to, and the callback that should be called
when a message arrives.

For example:
```toit
import mqtt
import encoding.json

TOPIC ::= "my/topic"

subscribe client/mqtt.Client:
  client.subscribe TOPIC:: | topic/string payload/ByteArray |
    decoded := json.decode payload
    print "Received value on '$topic': $(decoded["value"])"
```

Here, we decode the incoming payload with the JSON decoder. If the data payload should just be interpreted as a
string, you can simply call `payload.to_string` instead.

Since MQTT clients can have a session on the server, we could receive packets for previously subscribed topics
as soon as the client connects. If the `subscribe` function wasn't called yet, then the callback wouldn't be
invoked for these early messages. To avoid losing packets, the client can also be configured with routes at
construction time:

```
main:
  network := net.open
  transport := mqtt.TcpTransport.tls network --host=HOST
      --root_certificates=[ certificate_roots.ISRG_ROOT_X1 ]
  routes := {
    TOPIC: :: | topic/string payload/ByteArray |
      decoded := json.decode payload
      print "Received value on '$topic': $(decoded["value"])"
  }
  client := mqtt.Client --transport=transport --routes=routes
  client.start --client_id=CLIENT_ID
  // Client is now connected and subscribed to the given routes.
```

## TLS

The `TcpTransport` mentioned above can also be used to connect to secure servers.


```toit
import mqtt
import net
import net.x509

// Include a random number, as we are sharing test.mosquitto.org with other users.
CLIENT_ID ::= "my-client-id-$(random)"
HOST      ::= "test.mosquitto.org"

main:
   network := net.open
  transport := mqtt.TcpTransport.tls network --host=HOST
      --root_certificates=[ CERTIFICATE ]
  client := mqtt.Client --transport=transport
  client.start --client_id=CLIENT_ID
  // Client is now connected.

CERTIFICATE ::= x509.Certificate.parse """

The certificate was provided by the test.mosquitto.org page. Frequently, users don't need to
copy in certificates, though, and can just use the
[certificate_roots package](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-cert-roots).
