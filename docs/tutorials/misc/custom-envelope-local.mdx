# Creating a custom envelope locally
Envelopes are Toit's way of packaging the native firmware and Toit containers
together. After going through an extraction process, this is what is flashed to
devices.

Envelopes are designed to be modified, so that Toit containers can be added or
removed from them. This approach makes it possible to download precompiled
envelopes, where the native firmware has been built for you, and then add your
own Toit containers to them.

Toit already provides multiple envelopes at
[the envelopes repository](https://github.com/toitlang/envelopes). However,
if you need a different configuration of the native firmware, then you
might need to create your own custom envelope.

This tutorial will show you how to create a custom envelope locally on your
machine. See the [GitHub action tutorial](./custom-envelope) for information on
how to create a custom envelope using GitHub actions.

## Prerequisites
Contrary to almost all other tutorials, this tutorial requires to compile
C/C++ code. This means that you need to have a full build environment
installed. See the [Toitlang's build instructions](https://github.com/toitlang/toit?tab=readme-ov-file#building) for more information.

## Template
To make it easier to create a custom envelope, we have created a template
that you can use. The template is available at
[the custom envelope template repository](https://github.com/toitlang/template-custom-envelope).

<Note>

The template repository is optimized for macOS and Linux. If you are using
Windows, you might need to adjust some of the scripts.

</Note>

The following instructions summarize
 [GitHub's cloning instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository)
to duplicate the repository.

Start by creating a fresh repository on GitHub. Then run the following
commands, replacing `your-owner/your-repo` with the name of your repository:

``` shell
git clone --bare https://github.com/toitlang/template-custom-envelope.git
cd template-custom-envelope.git
git push --mirror git@github.com:your-owner/your-repo.git
cd ..
rm -rf template-custom-envelope.git
cd your-repo
```

### Configuring the template
As the README of the template repository explains, you need to configure
the template to match your needs. For this tutorial we assume that you are
using an ESP32 (the default), and that you will modify license, and the CI
action at a later point. We will also keep the echo-service in the components
directory, for now. You should remove it if you don't need it. See
the [c-service tutorial](../c-service) for more information.

Update the toit SDK to your preferred version, and then initialize the submodules.
The SDK version you want depends on your needs. If you want to use
an installed [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar), you should use the
same SDK version as Jaguar uses. You can find its SDK version by running
`jag version`. Once you know the version run the following commands:

``` shell
pushd toit
git checkout YOUR_VERSION
git submodule update --init --recursive
popd
```

<Note>

Toit snapshots are only compatible with the SDK version they were compiled with.
Always make sure that the SDK version in the template matches the SDK version
you are using.

</Note>

Run the init step, which will copy some files from the Toit repository:

``` shell
make init
```

## Changing the sdkconfig
The most common reason to create a custom envelope is to change the
`sdkconfig` file. This file is used by the ESP-IDF build system to configure
the native firmware.

To change the `sdkconfig` file, you can run:

``` shell
make menuconfig
```

This will open a menu where you can change the configuration. For example, you
can disable Bluetooth support (to save memory and space), or change the default
name of the device. Use '/' to search for a specific configuration. The
bluetooth configuration would be `BT_ENABLED`, and the device name
`LWIP_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` (for network) and `CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_SVC_GAP_DEVICE_NAME` for
Bluetooth.

When you are done, save the configuration and exit the menu. This will trigger
an automatic creation of `sdkconfig.defaults`. We recommend to commit both
files (`sdkconfig` and `sdkconfig.defaults`) to your repository.

Running `make diff` you should now see your changes compared to the default
configuration of a Toit envelope.

## Build
To build the custom envelope, run:

``` shell
make
```

This will first build the Toit SDK for your platform, and then build the
native firmware. The result is an `firmware.envelope` file in the `build/esp32`
directory.

### Jaguar
If you have Jaguar installed, you can flash the envelope to your device by
running the following command:

``` shell
jag flash build/esp32/firmware.envelope
```

### Containers
You can add containers to the envelope and then flash it, or use it for OTA
updates.

We recommend to copy the envelope to a different name, so that you can keep
the original envelope as a empty starting point. The `toit` executable can
be found in `build/host/sdk/bin`.

``` shell
cp build/esp32/firmware.envelope my-envelope.envelope
toit compile --snapshot -o hello.snapshot hello.toit
toit tool firmware -e firmware-esp32 container install hello hello.snapshot
```

#### Flash
Use the `firmware` tool to flash the envelope to your device. Adjust the port to your
device's port. The `toit` executable can be found in `build/host/sdk/bin`:

``` shell
toit tool firmware -e my-envelope.envelope flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```
## GitHub action
The template repository comes with a GitHub action that builds the envelope.
You can adjust it, so that it uploads the created envelope to a release.

We recommend to include the SDK version in the release name, so that you can
easily find the correct envelope for a specific SDK version.

## Conclusion
This tutorial showed how to create a custom envelope. The template repository
provides a good starting point, and you can adjust it to your needs.
