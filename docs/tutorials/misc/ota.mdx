# Over the air (OTA) Updates
In this tutorial we will learn how to update the firmware of the ESP32
over the air (OTA). This mechanism is used by `jag firmware update` or
by [Artemis](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases) whenever
a new firmware is sent to the device.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

The OTA program will use HTTP to download the new firmware. While not
necessary, you can have a look at the [HTTP tutorial](../../network/http)
first.

A new firmware consists of updating a Toit firmware envelope with
the desired containers and to build a binary image out of it.
We will provide the necessary steps to create a new firmware, but
you might need to update your setup to have the required tools
(`toit.compile` and `firmware`) accessible. See the
[containers tutorial](../../containers/toit-sdk) for how to
set up your environment, and for more information on how containers
and envelopes work.

## Packages
We are going to download the new firmware through HTTP. As such, we will
use the
[http](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-http@v2)
package. To install it, run the following command:

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitlang/pkg-http@v2
```

See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for more information on Toit's package management system.

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install http`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

## Introduction
The ESP32 has two partitions for storing firmware. This allows us to
update the firmware without the risk of bricking the device. The
firmware is always running from one of the partitions, while the other
one is used for updating the firmware. When the update is complete, the
device will reboot and run the new firmware. To avoid getting stuck with
a bad firmware, the new firmware then needs to "validate" the update.
Otherwise, the device runs the old firmware again once it reboots.

In this tutorial we will thus have two programs: one that downloads the
new firmware and writes it to the other partition, and one that is
run with the new firmware and validates the update.

## The validator
The validator is a simple program that prints a message and then
validates the update. Without that step the device would boot into
the old firmware after a reboot. (Feel free to leave the validation
out if you want to test the recovery mechanism.)

Typically, a validating program would check some important properties,
like access to a server, before validating the update. If the check
fails, the program would eventually just reboot the device, which would
then run the old firmware again.

Create a file `validate.toit` with the following content:

``` toit
import system.firmware

main:
  print "hello after update"

  if firmware.is-validation-pending:
    if firmware.validate:
      print "firmware update validated"
    else:
      print "firmware update failed to validate"
```

This program imports the `system.firmware` library, which provides
the `is-validation-pending` and `validate` functions. The first function
returns `true` if the device booted into a new firmware, but has not
yet validated the update. The second function validates the update and
returns `true` if the validation was successful.

## Preparing the new firmware
A new firmware needs to be extracted from Toit's firmware envelopes. Each
SDK version comes with a set of envelopes the user can choose from. See
the [release assets](https://github.com/toitlang/toit/releases) for the
latest SDK release and its envelopes.

Download the envelope you want to use. For this tutorial we will use
`firmware-esp32.gz`. Gunzip it and extract the file:

``` shell
gunzip firmware-esp32.gz
```

You should now have a file called `firmware-esp32`.

Compile the validate program to a snapshot and add it to the envelope:

``` shell
toit.compile -w validate.snapshot validate.toit
firmware -e firmware-esp32 container install validate validate.snapshot
```

Optionally, add other containers to the envelope.

Run the `firmware` tool again to extract a binary image from the envelope:

``` shell
firmware -e firmware-esp32 extract --format=binary -o ota.bin
```

### Makefile
For reference, here is a Makefile that creates an `ota.bin` file. It uses a
different name for the envelope file (`firmware.envelope`), but otherwise
follows the same steps.

The paths are set up for a Linux system with the Toit SDK installed in
`/opt/toit-sdk`. You might need to adjust the paths to match your setup.


``` makefile
TOIT_SDK := /opt/toit-sdk
TOIT_COMPILE := $(TOIT_SDK)/bin/toit.compile
TOIT_FIRMWARE := $(TOIT_SDK)/tools/firmware
VERSION := $(shell $(TOIT_SDK)/bin/toit.lsp version)
ENVELOPE_URL := https://github.com/toitlang/toit/releases/download/$(VERSION)/firmware-esp32.gz

.PHONY: all
all: ota.bin

# Always repuild the firmware envelope since we modify it.
.PHONY: firmware.envelope
firmware.envelope: firmware.envelope.gz
	gunzip -c firmware.envelope.gz > firmware.envelope

firmware.envelope.gz:
	curl -L -o $@ $(ENVELOPE_URL)

%.snapshot: %.toit
	$(TOIT_COMPILE) -w $@ $<

ota.bin: validate.snapshot firmware.envelope
	$(TOIT_FIRMWARE) -e firmware.envelope container install validate validate.snapshot
	$(TOIT_FIRMWARE) -e firmware.envelope extract --format=binary -o ota.bin

.PHONY: serve
serve: ota.bin
	python3 -m http.server 8000

.PHONY: version
version:
	@echo $(VERSION)
```

## Serving the new firmware
For this tutorial the new firmware needs to be served over HTTP. You can use
any HTTP server you want, including the one presented in
[the HTTP file server tutorial](../../network/http-file-server), but for
simplicity we will use Python's built-in HTTP server.

``` shell
python3 -m http.server
```

This will serve the current directory on port 8000. Make sure the `ota.bin`
file is in the current directory.

Now find the IP address of your desktop computer. You can use one
of the following commands to find your LAN address:
- Linux: `ip -j route get 1`
- Macos: `route -n get default`
- Windows: `ipconfig`

## Installing the firmware
We will now write a program that downloads the new firmware and writes
it to the other partition. Create a file `ota.toit` with the following
content. Don't forget to replace `<YOUR_IP>` with the IP address of your
desktop computer, as found in the previous step.

<!-- RESET CODE -->
<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
``` toit
import http
import io
import net
import system.firmware

UPDATE-URL := "http://<YOUR_IP>:8000/ota.bin"

install-firmware reader/io.Reader -> none:
  firmware-size := reader.content-size
  print "installing firmware with $firmware-size bytes"
  written-size := 0
  writer := firmware.FirmwareWriter 0 firmware-size
  try:
    last := null
    while data := reader.read:
      written-size += data.size
      writer.write data
      percent := (written-size * 100) / firmware-size
      if percent != last:
        print "installing firmware with $firmware-size bytes ($percent%)"
        last = percent
    writer.commit
    print "installed firmware; ready to update on chip reset"
  finally:
    writer.close

main:
  network := net.open
  client := http.Client network
  try:
    response := client.get --uri=UPDATE-URL
    install-firmware response.body
  finally:
    client.close
    network.close
  firmware.upgrade
```

Note that the program expects the server to return a `Content-Length`
header with the size of the firmware. Given this header, the
`body` field of the response will have the `content-size` field set, giving
us access to the size of the firmware. The program could also obtain the
firmware size in other ways.

Flashing the firmware consists of three steps:
1. Create a `FirmwareWriter` with the size of the firmware.
2. Write the firmware to the writer.
3. Commit the writer.

Finally, when the firmware is flashed, we call `firmware.upgrade` to
reboot the device and run the new firmware.

### Running the program
Typically, this program would be executed without Jaguar, as part
of a container that was installed together with the firmware.

However, as long as Jaguar is not writing to the flash at the same time,
(un)installing containers or a new firmware, it is safe to run the
program with Jaguar. After a reboot the new firmware will then
be running without the Jaguar service. You would need to reflash
the device through Jaguar to get the Jaguar service back.

``` shell
jag run ota.toit
```

## WiFi
Depending on how you have configured the network on your device, you might
need to bake the WiFi credentials into the OTA image. This can be done
by adding a config file with the credentials to the extraction step.

``` makefile
WIFI_CREDENTIALS := {"wifi.ssid":"<my-ssid>","wifi.password":"<my-password>"}

ota.bin: validate.snapshot firmware.envelope
	$(TOIT_FIRMWARE) -e firmware.envelope container install validate validate.snapshot
	$(TOIT_FIRMWARE) -e firmware.envelope property set wifi '$(WIFI_CREDENTIALS)'
	$(TOIT_FIRMWARE) -e firmware.envelope extract --format=binary -o ota.bin
```

We also recommend to only validate a new image once a network connection has been
established. Otherwise, the device might be able to boot, but not connect to the
network, and thus become unreachable.

## Conclusion
We have seen how to update the firmware of the ESP32 over the air.

The program we wrote is very simple, but it can be extended to
check for updates periodically, and to fetch the new firmware from
a public server (like a GitHub release page).
