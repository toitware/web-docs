# Containers in Artemis
[Artemis](/getstarted/fleet) is Toit's fleet management system. It
takes full advantage of Toit's containerization to provide a
convenient way to manage multiple programs on a device.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have read the [container introduction](../).

## Pod specification
Containers are usually declared in the
[pod specification](/getstarted/fleet/pods#specifications).

For example:
``` json
  "containers": {
    "hello": {
      "entrypoint": "hello.toit"
    },
    "solar": {
      "entrypoint": "examples/solar_example.toit",
      "git": "https://github.com/toitware/toit-solar-position.git",
      "branch": "v0.0.3"
    }
  }
```

When building a pod, Artemis will compile the container programs
(potentially downloading them via `git`) and bundle the resulting
binaries into the pod.

Pods can then be used to update devices. See the
[fleet description](/getstarted/fleet) for more information.

## Installing containers manually
Artemis also supports installing containers manually on individual
devices. In that case, Artemis behaves slightly similar to
Jaguar, in that containers are installed dynamically on the device
and are executed without the device needing to reboot. However,
Artemis (contrary to Jaguar) installs containers asynchronously. That is,
Artemis uploads the container and updates the device's configuration
to install the container, but it does not wait for the container to
be installed before returning. The next time the device connects to
the broker it will download and install the container.

To install a container manually, use the following command:
``` shell
artemis device -d <device-id> container install <container-name> <path-to-program>
```

Containers can also be installed with triggers, such as `--trigger=gpio-high:32`.
See the help of the `container install` command.

<Note>

Containers that are installed manually are lost when the device
updates to a new pod. In the `artemis fleet status` output,
devices that have manually installed containers are marked
as "Modified".
