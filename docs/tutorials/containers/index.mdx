# Containers
Toit uses virtual machine technology to support running multiple
containers on your device. The containers are developed and
maintained independently from each other and the virtual machine
provides the capabilities for safely running your platform-independent
applications, services, and drivers side-by-side.

Containers can be installed dynamically, in which case a program
on the device downloads the container and installs it. Installing
containers this way does not require a firmware update. In fact,
the container can be started without even rebooting the device.
[Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar), Toit's development
tool, uses this method to install containers, and provide rapid
development cycles.

<Note>

Containers must be compiled with the same SDK version as the firmware.

</Note>

Alternatively, containers can be installed statically, where they
are bundled together with a firmware. These bundles are called
envelopes and are an integral part of Toit's firmware process.

When flashing a device, Toit's tools take a firmware envelope (with,
or without additional containers) as input and flash it onto the
device. Similarly, Toit (and the corresponding tools) use firmware
envelopes as input which are then transformed into binary data
that can be sent to the device and flashed.

Different tools have different capabilities:
- the [SDK tools](./toit-sdk) are specialized for working with
  envelopes (typically before flashing).
- [Jaguar](./jaguar) only modifies containers dynamically.
- [Artemis](./artemis) bundles containers with the OTA firmware,
  but can also install containers dynamically without
  needing a firmware update.
