# Containers

TBD. For now just some notes.

## Jaguar
``` shell
jag container install <container-name> <path-to-program>
jag container uninstall <container-name>
jag container list
```

## Toit
Pure Toit without Jaguar.

Assumes that Toit's firmware tool is
available as `firmware`. In a local build it is located at
`build/host/sdk/tools/firmware`.

Assumes that a Toit firmware envelope is available as
`firmware.envelope`. In a local build it is located at
`build/esp32/firmware.envelope`.

Assumes that the Toit compiler is available as `toit.compile`.
In a local build it is located at `build/host/sdk/bin/toit.compile`.

``` shell
toit.compile -w hello.snapshot hello.toit
# By using '-o' we don't modify the envelope but create a new one.
firmware -e firmware.envelope -o hello.envelope container install hello hello.snapshot
```

The created envelope can be flashed to a device using the `flash` command.

``` shell
firmware -e hello.envelope flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600
```

## Artemis

Containers are usually declared in the
[pod specification](/getstarted/fleet/pods#specifications).

They can also be installed manually on specific devices. Containers
that are installed this way will be removed with the next update.

``` shell
artemis device -d <device-id> container install <container-name> <path-to-program>
```
