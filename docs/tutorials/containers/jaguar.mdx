# Containers and Jaguar
[Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) is Toit's development
tool. It dynamically installs and runs program (as containers) on
devices.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have read the [container introduction](../).

## Listing containers

When Jaguar is flashed onto a device (with `jag flash`) it automatically
adds a service version of Jaguar as container to the device. All other
programs that are executed or installed with Jaguar are installed
dynamically.

After [flashing Jaguar](../setup/firstprogram) onto a device, you can
list the installed containers:

``` shell
jag container list
```

By default this should list a single container called `jaguar`.

``` text
ᐅ jag container list
DEVICE     IMAGE                                  NAME
kind-bet   cfdacf51-230f-2628-53dc-fe8c011c0ae6   jaguar
```

## Installing containers
You can install additional containers with the `jag container install`:

``` shell
jag container install hello hello.toit
```

Note that Jaguar automatically compiles the given program (`hello.toit`)
into a snapshot before installing it.

Containers that are installed this way are automatically started after
installation and at boot time.

## Uninstalling containers
You can uninstall containers with `jag container uninstall`:

``` shell
jag container uninstall hello
```

## Disabling Jaguar
Sometimes it can be useful or necessary to
[disable Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar#temporarily-disabling-jaguar)
when running a specific container.

This can be done by installing the container with the `-D jag.disabled`
flag:

``` shell
jag container install -D jag.disabled hello hello.toit
```

At the next boot this gives the container 10 seconds to run before Jaguar
is started. If 10 seconds is not enough, you can specify a different
timeout with `-D jag.timeout=<duration>`, where `<duration>` is a
duration string like `10s` or `1m`.

Example:
``` shell
jag container install -D jag.disabled -D jag.timeout=1m hello hello.toit
```

### Use cases
The primary use case for disabling Jaguar is to run a container that
needs full access to the WiFi module. For example, a container that
implements a WiFi access point. The
[provision](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-provision@v0.2.0)
package falls into this category.

Disabling Jaguar can also be used to limit battery usage. For example,
a program could sample a sensor at regular intervals and immediately go
to [deep-sleep](../hardware/deepsleep) without giving Jaguar a chance to
run and start the WiFi. Only if a certain condition is met (like a
button is pressed), it could avoid the call to `deep_sleep` and
instead let Jaguar run.

<Note>

We don't recommend keeping Jaguar active in production devices, since
it gives the user full access to the device. Instead, we recommend
to use [Artemis](/getstarted/fleet) instead.
