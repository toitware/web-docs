# Packages
The Toit framework comes with lots of convenience methods, but much more
functionality is available in packages. Packages are Toit libraries that
are publicly available and can be used by anyone. They are published on the
Toit package registry.

Go to https://pkg.toit.io/packages to see all available packages. A lot of
them are drivers for sensors (like the
[bme280](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Fbme280-driver)
package), but other packages contain code that is useful on its own. For
example, the
[solar_position](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-solar-position)
package calculates the sunrise and sunset times for a given place and date on Earth.

## Initializing a project
Before using packages, it is recommended to initialize a project first. Toit
will do this automatically when installing the first package, but we
recommend to explicitly initialize a folder as a project root.

Move into the folder where you want to create your project and run the
following command:

```shell
jag pkg init
```

This creates a `package.yaml` and `package.lock` file. Usually, you will
not need to edit these files manually, but it is good to know what they
are for.

The `package.yaml` file is used to specify which packages are needed for
the project. The `package.lock` file is used to record which versions of
the packages have been installed. Both files should be committed to your
source-code management system (usually git).

## Installing new packages
Packages can be installed with the `jag pkg install` command. For example,
to install the `ntp` package one can write:

```shell
jag pkg install ntp
```

One can also install packages using their name (like `ntp` here), but this
only works as long as the name isn't ambiguous. Since different developers
can contribute packages, there is no guarantee that package names remain
unique.

The most stable way to install a package is to use the full package ID,
together with the requested major version:

```shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitlang/pkg-ntp@1
```

This will install the latest version of the `pkg-ntp` package that is
compatible with version 1 of the package. Usually, we use the short
version when installing packages by hand, but use a more qualified
version in tutorials or documentation. This way we can make sure that
the code will still work when a new version of the package is released,
or when a new package with the same name is released.

### Installing project packages
When a project uses packages, each user needs to install the packages
locally. This is done by running `jag pkg install` in the project root.
This will install all packages that are listed in the `package.lock` file
thus making sure that all users use the same versions of the packages.

### Updating packages
A project continues using the same versions of the packages (fixed
in the `package.lock` file) until the `jag pkg update` command is
run. This command will update the `package.lock` file to use the latest
compatible versions of the packages.

## Using packages
Once a package has been installed, it can be imported by writing
`import PACKAGE-NAME`. For the `ntp` package that would be
`import ntp`.

### Selecting a library
When importing a package with the package name (like `import ntp`), Toit
automatically selects the `PACKAGE-NAME.toit` library (`ntp.toit`) of
that package.

If a package has multiple libraries, or if it doesn't have a
`PACKAGE-NAME.toit` library, then one needs to select the correct library
by adding a dot followed by the library that is needed. For example, the
[host](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-host@v1)
package has no `host.toit` library, but one could use the `directory.toit`
as follows:

```toit
import host.directory
```

Most packages have a nice entry-point so you rarely need to worry about this.

## Project root
Toit packages are installed per project, wherea  project is a folder that
contains a `package.yaml`/`package.lock` file.

Package commands assume that the current working directory is the project
root. If that's not the case, you can specify the project root with the
`--project-root` flag.

For example, to install the `ntp` package in the current directory, run:

```shell
jag pkg install ntp
```

However, to install the `ntp` package in the `my_project` directory, run:

```shell
jag pkg install ntp --project-root=my_project
```

## The .packages folder
When installing a package, Jaguar creates a .packages folder in your
project and stores the downloaded code there. This folder should not
be committed to your source-code management system.

Alternatively, one can make sure that a package is installed in the right
place, by telling Jaguar where the project root is located:
```shell
jag pkg install toitlang/pkg-ntp@1 --project-root=PATH_TO_PROJECT
```

In our examples and tutorials we recommend to just open a folder with
Visual Studio Code, and then to run Jaguar commands in one of its terminals.
Visual Studio Code automatically moves the shell to the right place, thus
avoiding the need to specify the project root.

The command to install all packages is simply jag pkg install. This takes the
package.yaml/lock files and downloads the same packages again.
