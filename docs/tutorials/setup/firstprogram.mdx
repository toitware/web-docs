# Hello world

This tutorial shows how to create a simple "Hello world" application and
how to run it on a Jaguar-enabled device.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../ide).

## Creating the project
While not strictly necessary we recommend starting new projects in a separate
folder. Toit stores [package](../packages) information in a hidden folder
and it is easier to keep track of things if you have one folder per project. We
are not going to use packages in this tutorial yet, but it's a good habit to
get into.

Once you have created a new folder (say `hello`) open it in vscode:
File -> Open Folder.

## The code
In your project folder create a new file called `hello.toit` and add the
following code:

```toit
main:
  print "Hello world"
```

Make sure to save it (or change the vscode `files.autoSave` setting to
`onFocusChange`).

Spaces are important in Toit, so make sure that the `print` line is indented
compared to the `main:` line. Generally, we write nested things with two more
spaces of indentation. If your vscode insists on using tabs or four spaces
consider changing the following settings:
- `editor.tabSize` to 2, or change `editor.indentSize` to 2.
- `editor.insertSpaces` to true
- `editor.detectIndentation` to false

## Running the code
We are now ready to run the code. As described in the [IDE tutorial](../ide)
we typically have two terminals open: one where we interact with the device,
and one where we monitor the output of the device. In this setup, run
`jag run hello.toit` in the first terminal.

<img
  src={HelloJagRun}
  alt="Screenshot of running the hello world program"
/>

Within a fraction of a second Jaguar compiled the program and ran it on the
device. The terminal monitoring the serial port shows the output of the
program.

Let's change the program to emit a different output:

```toit
main:
  print "hi everyone"
```

Save it and run `jag run hello.toit` again. The new output should be
visible on the monitor terminal.

## Watching a Toit file
Jaguar has a nice functionality that automatically runs applications as soon
as they are saved: `jag watch <file>` watches a file for changes and
immediately runs it as soon as a new version has been saved.

Run `jag watch hello.toit` in the first terminal. Then change the program
and save it. Without having to execute `jag run` again the new version should
be running on the device.

<img
  src={HelloJagWatch}
  alt="Screenshot of Jaguar watching the hello world program"
/>

Use ctrl+c to stop the watching. You will want to do this when you are done,
or when you want to watch a different file.

## Next steps
Congratulations! You have successfully created and run your first Toit
application.

You can now move on to the [package tutorial](../packages)
to learn how Toit packages work, or directly jump to the
[LED tutorial](../../hardware/led) to learn how to blink an LED.
