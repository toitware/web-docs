# Setting up the IDE
This tutorial guides the reader through the installation process. It is an
extended version of the [Get Started](../getstarted) documentation.

Start by installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
(henceforth "vscode").

Then install [Jaguar (Releases)](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases).

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Windows">

On Windows 10+ simply open powershell, and run:
```shell
winget install --id=Toit.Jaguar -e
```

For older Windows versions, download and install Jaguar from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_installer.exe).

</Tab>
<Tab label="macOS">

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Jaguar as follows:
```shell
brew install jaguar
```

Or you can download and install Jaguar manually from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag.dmg).

</Tab>

<Tab label="Linux">

On Archlinux there is an AUR package, which can be installed with:

```shell
yay install jaguar-bin
```

Or download the precompiled binary from [here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_linux.tgz).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Visual Studio Code has an integrated terminal.

/>

Whenever we ask you to run a command, use this terminal. To do that
simply open a new terminal (or use an existing one) and type the command
there.

Run the following command in a terminal:
``` bash
jag setup
```

If this step is skipped the extension will remind you later.

### Install the Toit extension
In vscode click on the gear icon and then "extensions".

Search for Toit and install the extension.

## Open a folder
When working in Toit we recommend to use separate folders for different
projects. Vscode has the notion of "opened folder" which is used by
the Toit extension to know where to put files and whether files are related.

After opening a folder, vscode also automatically opens terminals in that folder,
which is often a requirement when running commands (specifically package
commands).

Click on "Open Folder" and go into a (probably fresh) folder.

When you open a new terminal you should now see the name of the
folder (although this depends on your operating system).

## Prepare a device
Plug in your ESP32, and, in a terminal, run the following command:

``` bash
jag flash
```

Select the USB port the device is connected to. If no correct serial port shows up, have
a look at our [trouble-shooting page](../../../support/troubleshoot/serialtroubleshoot)
or follow the guide on Espressif's page to
[establish a serial connection with the ESP32](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html).

Then enter the WiFi credentials of the network you want to connect to.

<img
  src={JagWiFi}
  alt="Screenshot of the jag flash command asking for WiFi credentials"
/>

As soon as the credentials are submitted, the flashing process starts.

<img
  src={JagFlash}
  alt="Screenshot of the jag flash command flashing the device"
/>

When the flashing is done, run `jag monitor` to verify that the device is
connecting correctly to the WiFi:

<img
  src={JagMonitor}
  alt="Screenshot of the jag monitor command showing the output of the device"
/>

The `jag monitor` will run until stopped with `ctrl+c`, or when the device is
physically disconnected.

Running jag monitor has two effects:
* it reboots the device (unless used with `--attach`), and
* it shows the output of programs.

During development it's convenient to always have a terminal monitoring
the output of the device. A common setup thus consists of having two
terminals open at the same time. One to interact with the device
and one to monitor the output. Vscode's "split terminal" comes in handy
for this.

<img
  src={VscodeSplitTerminals}
  alt="Screenshot of vscode with two terminals"
/>

### Selecting a device
Jaguar has the notion of a "default device". This is the device that is used
when no device is specified. If you have multiple devices, or just want to
set the default one, you can select a device by running `jag scan`.

<img
  src={JagScan}
  alt="Screenshot of the jag scan command"
/>

Note: Jaguar uses UDP broadcast messages to find all ESP32 devices. This means
that the desktop and the ESP32 need to be in the same network for this to work.

If `jag scan` can't find your device, you can also help `jag` by providing the
IP address of the device. This is done by running `jag scan <ip-address>`. The
IP address can be found in the output of `jag monitor`. For example:

``` bash
jag scan 192.168.86.25
```

Your development environment is now ready to use. You can start writing
programs in Toit and run them on your device.

## Next steps
Have a look at the [first programs](../firstprogram) tutorial to learn how to
write a Toit program and run it on the device.
