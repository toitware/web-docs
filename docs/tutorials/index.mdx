# Tutorials

This section contains tutorials to get started with running Toit code on your device. The first tutorial will show you a simple Toit program that [logs the date and time](starter) on your device.

Next, we will show you the difference between running code once on your device and deploying long-lived Toit apps on your device, even when your device is offline and in deep sleep mode.
The tutorial will show you to build a [Weather station](starter/weatherstation) with your device.

We will also show you how devices can communicate with each other.
Follow the two tutorials, which show how to utilize the Publish/Subscribe service that Toit offers for easy device communication:
either [within a device](pubsub), where two apps running on the same device are communicating, or between two distinct devices that [communicate via the Toit cloud](pubsub/pubsubext).

Finally, we have tutorials on how to use [Bluetooth Low-Energy communication](ble) with Toit on your ESP32 device,
as well as an example of how to use [MQTT](mqtt) to send and receive messages to and from your Toit devices.
