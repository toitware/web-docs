# Telegram
This tutorial shows you how to create a Telegram bot that runs on your device.
With this setup it is easy to control your device from anywhere in the world,
or to send notifications from your device to your phone (or any other device
that has Telegram installed).

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

Note that you can do this tutorial without a device. In that case,
you need to use the `-d host` option whenever you invoke
`jag run`. The program will then run on your computer instead of on
a device.

You will need a Telegram account to do this tutorial.

## Create a Telegram bot
To create a Telegram bot, you need to talk to the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
This is a bot that helps you create other bots.

Start a conversation with the BotFather by clicking on the link above.
Then type `/newbot` and follow the instructions. You will be asked to
give your bot a name and a username. The username must end with `bot`.
For example, you can call your bot `ToitBot` and give it the username
`ToitBot_bot`. The bot names are globally unique, so you may have to
try a few different names before you find one that is available.

When you are done, the BotFather will give you a token that you can
use to access your bot. You will need this token later.

See the official
[BotFather documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather).

## Toit program
Now that we have a bot, we can write a Toit program that uses it.

### Packages
We will use the `telegram` package to communicate with the Telegram bot. Install
it with the following command. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

```shell
jag pkg install github.com/floitsch/toit-telegram@0.5
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install telegram`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

Feel free to use a newer version of the package if one is available. You
might need to update the code samples below if you do.

</Note>

### Code
The following program implements a simple bot that listens for
messages that are sent to it (in a private chat). It will reply
to these messages with an "Of course!" message.

Don't forget to replace `<YOUR TOKEN>` with the token that you got
from the BotFather.

<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
```toit
import telegram show *

TELEGRAM_TOKEN ::= "<YOUR TOKEN>"

main:
  client := Client --token=TELEGRAM_TOKEN
  my_username := client.get_me.username

  client.listen: | update/Update? |
    if update is UpdateMessage:
      print "Got message: $update"
      message := (update as UpdateMessage).message
      if message.chat and message.chat.type == Chat.TYPE_PRIVATE:
        client.send_message "Of course!"
            --chat_id=message.chat.id
```

For a more useful bot, you would probably want to do something more
interesting than just replying to messages. For example, you could
use the bot to control a peripheral on your device, or to send
notifications to your phone when a sensor value changes.
