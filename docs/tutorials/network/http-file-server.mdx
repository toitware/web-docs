# HTTP
In this tutorial we will write an HTTP file server. The server
takes the HTTP path and serves the corresponding file from the
local file system. In spirit it is very similar to
python's `python -m http.server` command.

You will learn how to use the `http` package to serve HTML pages and the
`host` package to list local files.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

This tutorial is written for the desktop and not the ESP32. You should
still have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.
However, instead of running the program on the ESP32, you should run it
on your desktop, using the `-d host` option to the `jag run` command. Note,
that `jag watch` does not support the `-d` option, so you will have to
manually restart the program after each change.

## Packages
The HTTP functionality is not part of the core libraries and must be
imported as a package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [http](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-http@v2)
package. To install it, run the following command:

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitlang/pkg-http@v2
```

For file access we will use the
[host](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-host@v1)
package. To install it, run the following command:

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitlang/pkg-host@v1
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install http` and `jag pkg install host`,
but the full IDs together with the versions are more explicit, and will
make sure you get the right packages.

Feel free to use a newer version of the package if one is available. You
might need to update the code samples below if you do.

</Note>

## Code
Create a new file called `file-server.toit`, and start by adding the imports
and constants:

<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
``` toit
import host.file
import host.directory
import http
import net

CSS ::= """
"""
```

For now we leave the CSS empty. We will add some content later.

We can now add the `main` function:

``` toit
main:
  network := net.open
  server-socket := network.tcp-listen 0
  port := server-socket.local-address.port
  print "Listening on http://localhost:$port/"

  clients := []
  server := http.Server
  task::
    server.listen server-socket:: | request/http.RequestIncoming response-writer/http.ResponseWriter |
      // Note that we are not sanitizing the path here.  This is a security
      // risk, as it allows a client to access files outside of the current
      // directory.
      path := "./$request.path"
      if file.is-file path:
        serve-file request.path response-writer
      else if file.is-directory path:
        serve-directory request.path response-writer
      else:
        response-writer.write-headers http.STATUS-NOT-FOUND --message="Not Found"
      response-writer.close
```

The `main` function starts by establishing a network connection on a random
port. It then creates a `Server` object and starts listening for incoming
connections.

Depending on the path of the request, we either serve a file, a directory
listing, or a 404 error.

The `serve-file` function is implemented as follows:

``` toit
serve-file request-path/string writer/http.ResponseWriter:
  path := "./$request-path"
  // Serve the file as binary data.
  writer.headers.add "content_type" "application/octet-stream"
  writer.headers.add "content_length" "$(file.size path)"
  stream := file.Stream.for-read path
  try:
    while chunk := stream.read:
      writer.write chunk
  finally:
    stream.close
```

It adds the correct headers and then pipes the file contents to the
response writer.

The `serve-directory` function is slightly more involved since it
needs to differentiate between files and directories:

``` toit
serve-directory request-path/string writer/http.ResponseWriter:
  // List the directory contents.
  path := "./$request-path"
  stream := directory.DirectoryStream path
  writer.headers.add "content_type" "text/html"
  writer.write """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Directory Listing - $request-path</title>
      <style>
        $CSS
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Directory Listing - $request-path</h1>
    """
  while entry := stream.next:
    entry-path := "$path/$entry"
    prefix := request-path.trim --right "/"
    entry-request-path := "$prefix/$entry"
    if file.is-directory entry-path:
      writer.write """
        <div class="directory">
          <a href="$entry-request-path">$entry/</a>
        </div>
      """
    else:
      writer.write """
        <div class="file">
          <a href="$entry-request-path" download>$entry</a>
        </div>
      """
  stream.close
  writer.write """
    </body>
    </html>
  """
```

Most of the function consists of HTML code. The key part is the
`while` loop. For each entry in the directory we check if it is a
file or a directory. We then generate the appropriate HTML.

## CSS
There are many ways to render a directory listing. We have chosen to
ask chat.openai.com for help. Our prompt was:

``` text
Create a CSS for a web page that will show a file system.
Users can click on files to download them, or click on directories to go into them.
Show an example HTML file that the server needs to generate to use this CSS.
```

This is what we got back:
``` CSS
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
}

.container {
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin-top: 10px;
}

.directory, .file {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 5px 0;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.3s;
}

.directory:hover, .file:hover {
    background-color: #e0e0e0;
}

.directory:before {
    content: "üìÅ ";
}

.file:before {
    content: "üìÑ ";
}

a {
    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

For reference, the AI model suggested the following HTML page
(Note: it was missing the charset meta tag):

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="your-stylesheet.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="directory">
            <a href="/path/to/directory1">Directory 1</a>
        </div>
        <div class="directory">
            <a href="/path/to/directory2">Directory 2</a>
        </div>
        <div class="file">
            <a href="/path/to/file1" download>File 1</a>
        </div>
        <div class="file">
            <a href="/path/to/file2" download>File 2</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
