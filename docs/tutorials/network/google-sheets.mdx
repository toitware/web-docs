# Log data to Google spreadsheets
In this tutorial we will show how to send data from an ESP32 to a Google
Spreadsheet.

## Requirements
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

Note that you can do this tutorial without a device. In that case,
you need to use the `-d host` option whenever you invoke
`jag run`. The program will then run on your computer instead of on
a device.

You will need a Google account to do this tutorial.

## Prepare the Google spreadsheet
First, we need to create a Google spreadsheet to log the data to. We
will prepare the sheet to log timestamps, temperature and humidity. If
you want to log other data, you can of course change this.

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/).
1. Click on the `+` button to create a new spreadsheet.
1. Name the spreadsheet `ESP32 data`.
1. In the first row, enter the following column headers:
   `Timestamp`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`.
1. Open the `Extensions` menu and select `Apps Script`.
1. Give the project a name, for example `ESP32 data logger`.
1. In the editor that opens, replace the default code with the following:
   ``` javascript
   /*
   OnlyCurrentDoc
   */
   function doPost(e) {
     var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
     var data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
     sheet.appendRow([new Date(data.timestamp), data.temperature, data.humidity]);
     return ContentService.createTextOutput("OK");
   }
   ```
1. Optionally add the following `doGet` function. This will allow you to
   test the script with a browser.
   ``` javascript
   function doGet(e) {
     var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
     var data = JSON.parse(e.parameter.data);
     sheet.appendRow([new Date(data.timestamp), data.temperature, data.humidity]);
     return ContentService.createTextOutput("OK");
   }
   ```
1. Save the project.
1. Click on the `Deploy` button and select `New deployment`.
1. Select `Web app` under "Select type".
1. Optionally add a description, for example "Initial deployment".
1. Under "Who has access to the app", select `Anyone".
1. Click on the `Deploy` button.
1. Authorize the app to access your Google account.
1. Copy the URL that is displayed in the dialog.
1. Click on the `OK` button to close the dialog.

If you ever lose the URL, you can find it again by opening the
`Manage Deployments` dialog. To do this, click on the `Deploy` button and
select `Manage deployments`. The URL is displayed in the dialog.


### Testing the script with the browser
If you added the `doGet` function, you can test your Google spreadsheet
setup with a browser.

Take the URL you received in the previous section and append the following to it:
``` text
?data={"timestamp":123456789,"temperature":25.0,"humidity":50.0}
```

The complete URL should now look like this:
``` text
https://script.google.com/macros/s/<SOME_ID>/exec?data={"timestamp":123456789,"temperature":25.0,"humidity":50.0}
```

Open this URL in your browser. You should see the text `OK` displayed, and the
data should be added to the spreadsheet.

You can simply delete the row from the spreadsheet to remove the data.

## Toit program
Now that we have a spreadsheet to log the data to, we can write the Toit
program that will send the data to it.

### Packages
The HTTP functionality is not part of the core libraries and must be
imported as a package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [http](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-http@v2)
package. To install it, run the following command:

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitlang/pkg-http@v2
```

We will also use the
[certificate-roots](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-cert-roots@v1)
package:

``` shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-cert-roots@v1
```

### Code
Start a new Toit program `sheets.toit` and watch it with Jaguar.

Don't forget to replace `<YOUR URL>` with the URL you received from
Google.

The program uses the `post_json` method on the HTTP `Client` class to
send the data to the spreadsheet. The `post_json` method will
automatically encode the data as JSON and set the `Content-Type` header
to `application/json`.

The `--no-follow_redirects` option is used to prevent the HTTP client
from following any redirects. The Google Apps Script returns a
redirect to a different site. That site is known to have a very big
certificate that might not fit into memory. By not following the
redirect we avoid potential issues with the page and also avoid
another HTTP request.

<!-- ANALYZE CODE -->
``` toit
import certificate_roots
import http
import net

URL ::= "<YOUR URL>"
CERTIFICATE ::= certificate_roots.GTS_ROOT_R1

main:
  network := net.open
  client := http.Client.tls network
      --root_certificates=[CERTIFICATE]

  response := client.post_json --no-follow_redirects --uri=URL {
    "timestamp": Time.now.utc.to_iso8601_string,
    "temperature": 42.0,
    "humidity": 1013.25,
  }

  if response.status_code != 200 and response.status_code != 302:
    print "Request failed: $response.status_code $response.status_message"

  response.drain
```

For simplicity we simply post some dummy data to the spreadsheet. In a real
application you would replace this with the actual data you want to log.

#### Timestamp
If your ESP32 hasn't synchronized with an NTP server, the timestamp will be
incorrect (somewhere in the 1970s). See the
[date-time tutorial](../../misc/date-time) for details on how to synchronize
the time.
