# Buzzer
In this tutorial we are going to use a passive buzzer. Contrary to
active buzzers, passive buzzers need to be driven by a signal with
a frequency. We will use the PWM functionality of the ESP32 to generate
a precise frequency.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have a basic understanding of how pulse width modulation
(henceforth "PWM") works, and how it is used in Toit. If necessary, have
a look at the [Fading LED tutorial](../pwm_led) first.

## Setup
Connect the buzzer as follows:
- Connect VCC to 3V3.
- Connect GND to GND.
- Connect SIG or I/O to pin 14.

## Code
Create a `buzzer.toit` file and watch it with Jaguar:

``` toit
import gpio
import gpio.pwm

buzz pin --frequency --ms:
  generator := pwm.Pwm --frequency=frequency
  channel := generator.start pin --duty_factor=0.5
  sleep --ms=ms
  channel.close
  generator.close

main:
  buzzer := gpio.Pin 14
  20.repeat:
    buzz buzzer --frequency=800 --ms=500
    buzz buzzer --frequency=1600 --ms=500
  buzzer.close
```


This time we moved some of the code into its own function
`buzz` so we can use the code multiple times without needing to copy it.

The function `buzz` takes three arguments:
* `pin`: the pin for which it should emit the frequency.
* `--frequency`, a named argument: the frequency at which the PWM
  should emit its square wave.
* `--ms`, a named argument: the duration, in milliseconds, for which
  the PWM should be active.

If everything goes well, the buzzer should emit a siren-like sound.

As you can see the PWM isn't fully designed for changing frequencies, and
the programming interface for it is a bit awkward. As the name implies
("pulse width modulation") it is easier to change the width of the pulses.

## Exercises
As long as the connections were done correctly you can't damage your
hardware by changing your program.

- Play the tune of "Smoke on the water" by Deep Purple.
- Cycle through some different frequencies.
