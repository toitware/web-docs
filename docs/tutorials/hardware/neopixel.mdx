# Neopixel
Neopixels are Adafruit's brand for WS2812 indivually-addressable RGB color pixel
strips. In this tutorial we will use the term Neopixel to refer to any WS2812
compatible LED strip (including the SK6812, which have an additional white LED, and
thus an existing color byte for each LED).

Neopixels are connected in series. Each LED has a data input pin (DI) and a data
output pin (DO). The DO pin of the first LED is connected to the DI pin of the second
LED, and so on. The DO pin of the last LED is not connected to anything.

When the first LED receives a signal on its DI pin, it will read the first 24 bits
(or 32 bits for SK6812) of the signal and then pass the rest on to the next LED.
The first 24 bits are interpreted as three 8-bit color values: red, green and blue
(and white for SK6812). The LED will then light up with the specified color, and
pass the rest of the signal on to the next LED.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

## Setup
Connect the LED strip as follows:
- Connect the 5V/power pin of the LED strip to the 5V pin of the ESP32. The
  5V pin of the ESP32 is often marked as VIN, since that's the 5V input that
  is provided by the USB connector.
- Connect the GND pin of the LED strip to the GND pin of the ESP32.
- Connect pin 13 of the ESP32 to the DI pin of the LED strip.

## Packages
The driver for pixel strips is not part of the standard Toit distribution,
but must be downloaded as package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [pixel_strip](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-pixel-strip)
package. To install it, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-pixel-strip@v0.3
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install pixel_strip`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

</Note>

## Code
Open a new file and save it as `neopixel.toit`,and watch it with Jaguar.

Insert the following program:

```toit
import gpio
import pixel_strip show PixelStrip

PIXELS ::= 12

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 13
  strip := PixelStrip.uart PIXELS --pin=pin

  r := ByteArray PIXELS
  g := ByteArray PIXELS
  b := ByteArray PIXELS

  current := 0
  while true:
    // Decrease intensity of all LEDs.
    PIXELS.repeat:
      r[it] = r[it] / 3
      g[it] = g[it] / 3
      b[it] = b[it] / 3

    // Set the current LED to full brightness.
    r[current] = 255
    g[current] = 255
    b[current] = 255

    // Show the current configuration.
    strip.output r g b

    // Sleep.
    sleep --ms=70

    // Prepare for the next round.
    current = (current + 1) % PIXELS
```

We are using the Uart version of the pixel-strip class. This means that the
package uses the ESP32's UART peripheral to implement the WS2812 protocol.
Since the UART functionality is well optimized the Toit program can continue
running while the LEDs are updated. In our case there are only 12 LEDs, and
communicating with them doesn't take a long time, but when a pixel string
has 300 LEDs or more, it's crucial that the hardware does most of the work.

We allocate three byte arrays. Each has PIXELS (set to 12) elements, and can
be used to set the red, green or blue color-components respectively.
Initially each byte is set to 0.

We then start an infinite loop (`while true`). Inside it we first decrease
the existing values by a factor of 3. In the very first iteration all values
are 0 and therefore nothing happens, but in later iterations this will
dim all lights.

Then we set the current LED to full brightness.

Finally, we send the new values to the strip, and wait 70ms.

Before the next iteration we move to the next LED.

## Exercises
The LED ring can draw a lot of power if many LEDs are at full brightness. This
can lead to brownouts where the ESP32 doesn't get enough power and
reboots/shuts down.

If this happens for [installed containers](../../containers/containers), Jaguar
might be unable to change the installed program, leading to a boot-loop.
In this case just unplug the power for the LEDs and install a program that
uses less power.

- Change the speed of the cycling LED.
- Change the color of the cycling LED. Google for RGB values to find some interesting colors.
- Instead of dimming the existing values equally, divide the individual color
  components differently. For example /2 for red, /3 for green and /4 for blue.
- Show a color wheel. Search for "RGB color wheel".
- Turn that wheel.
