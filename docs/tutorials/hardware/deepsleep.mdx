# Deep sleep
This tutorial will show how to put an ESP32 into deep sleep, and how
to wake it up again.

<Note>

If you are using [Toit's fleet management](../../getstarted/fleet), then
you don't need to worry about deep sleep. Artemis (the installed
container of the fleet management system) automatically puts the device
into deep sleep when it is not running any programs.

</Note>

## Requirements
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

While not necessary, we recommend to have done the [LED](../led),
[Button](../button) and [Touch button](../touch) tutorials before this one.

## Putting to sleep
The ESP32 can be put into deep sleep by calling the `deep_sleep` method of
the [`esp32`](https://libs.toit.io/esp32/library-summary) library. This method
takes a single argument, which is the duration of the sleep.

Write the following `sleep.toit` program and run it with Jaguar.

```toit
import esp32

main:
  esp32.deep_sleep (Duration --s=2)
```
This program will let the ESP32 sleep for 2 seconds, and then wake up again.

<Note type="warning">

If a program is installed as a [container](../../containers/containers)
and starts at boot, then an early `deep_sleep` call could make the
device unresponsive.

If your are using Jaguar for development, but Jaguar doesn't have the time
to start before the device goes back to sleep then you can't update the
program anymore. In this case you have to flash the device again.

You can avoid this by either ensuring that the device is awake for
a certain time, or by not going to sleep if a certain pin is
pulled low.

For example:

```toit
import gpio
import esp32

main:
  sleep_pin := gpio.Pin --input 33 --pull_up
  if sleep_pin.get != 0:
    // Not pulled low. Go to sleep.
    esp32.deep_sleep (Duration --s=2)
```

This way you always have a way to recover from such a scenario.

</Note>

## Wake up from external pin
The ESP32 can be woken up from deep sleep if certain pins are low or high.

### Setup
Connect pin 32 to ground (optionally with a 330Ω resistor in between).

### Code
Edit your `sleep.toit` program to the following:

```toit
import esp32

main:
  // Enable wakeup if pin 32 goes high.
  pin_mask := 1 << 32
  on_any_high := true
  esp32.enable_external_wakeup pin_mask on_any_high
  esp32.deep_sleep (Duration --m=3)
```

Run it, and then remove the connection between pin 32 and ground. Without
any pull-down resistor the pin is floating and thus measures mostly random
values. You are likely to see the ESP32 wake up almost immediately. If not,
try touching the pin with your finger or even connecting the pin to 3V3.

If you have a [button](../button) (especially the ones with integrated
pull-down resistors) you can also use it to wake up the ESP32.

## Wake up from touch
The ESP32 can also be woken up with the touch sensor.

### Setup
Connect a male-male jumper wire to pin 32. Keep one end of the wire
free. We will use this end as touch button.

### Code
Edit your `sleep.toit` program to the following and run it with Jaguar.
If necessary change the threshold value. See the [Touch button](../touch)
tutorial for more information about the touch sensor.

```toit
import esp32
import gpio
import gpio.touch as gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 32
  touch := gpio.Touch pin
  touch.threshold = 800
  esp32.enable_touchpad_wakeup
  esp32.deep_sleep (Duration --m=3)
```

The ESP32 will go to sleep for three minutes, or wake up if it
registers a touch on pin 32.

## Power consumption
When the ESP32 is in deep sleep it only consumes about 10µA. However,
this assumes that no other components are drawing any power. There are
significant differences between different ESP32 boards.

For example the FireBeetle ESP32 uses only 10µA when in deep sleep, the
Olimex ESP32-DevKit-LiPo around 65µA, and the ESP32-DevKitC up to 9mA.
