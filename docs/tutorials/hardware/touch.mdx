# Touch
This tutorial will show how to configure and use the ESP32 touch sensors.

The ESP32 touch sensor detects variations in capacitance on the GPIO pins,
thus detecting touch or proximity.

## Requirements
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

While not necessary, we recommend to have done the digital GPIO tutorials
[LED](../led) and [Button](../button) before this one.

## Setup
The ESP32 has 10 pins that can be used as touch sensors: 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 27,
32-33. In this tutorial we will use pin 32.

Simply connect a male-male (jumper) wire to pin 32, and leave the other end
unconnected. We will use the unconnected end as a touch sensor.

## Code
Create a new file `touch.toit` and start `jag watch touch.toit` to
run the program whenever you save.

```toit
import gpio
import gpio.touch as gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 32
  touch := gpio.Touch pin

  while true:
    print (touch.read --raw)
    sleep --ms=500
```

This program will print the raw value of the touch sensor every 500ms.
Typically, the raw value will be around 1000-1200 when the wire is
left untouched and decreases to around 200 when touched with a finger.

Take a value that is in the seen range (for example 800) and use
it in the following program as threshold.

```toit
import gpio
import gpio.touch as gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 32
  touch := gpio.Touch pin

  touch.threshold = 800

  while true:
    is_touched := touch.get
    print (is_touched ? "touched" : "not touched")
    sleep --ms=500
```
The program will now print `touched` when the wire is touched and
`not touched` when it is not touched. Compared to just looking at the
raw value, there isn't a huge advantage in using the `threshold`
in this example. However, the same `threshold` is also used when
a touch pin is used to wake up from [deep sleep](../deepsleep).

Often the calibration value (here 800) will be determined during
production and stored in the device's flash memory. You can also
do this calibration dynamically:

```
import gpio
import gpio.touch as gpio

ITERATIONS := 100

calibrate touch/gpio.Touch:
  sum := 0
  ITERATIONS.repeat:
    sum += touch.read --raw

  // Use 4/5th of the average as cutoff.
  threshold := (sum * 4) / (5 * ITERATIONS)
  print "Threshold: $threshold"
  touch.threshold = threshold

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 32
  touch := gpio.Touch pin

  calibrate touch

  while true:
    is_touched := touch.get
    print (is_touched ? "touched" : "not touched")
    sleep --ms=500
```
It's important that the wire is not touched during the calibration
phase.

<Note>

The Toit implementation of the touch sensor currently requires active polling.
