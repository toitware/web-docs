# Servo motor
In this tutorial we are going to use a servo motor. Servo motors are
commonly used in robotics. They are mass produced and can
be obtained cheaply. In contrast to "normal" motors, a servo motor is
designed to turn its shaft to a specific angle, depending on the signal
it gets.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have a basic understanding of how pulse width modulation
(henceforth "PWM") works, and how it is used in Toit. If necessary, have
a look at the [Fading LED tutorial](../pwm_led) first.

## Setup
Connect the servo as follows:
- Connect the red wire to 3.3V.
- Connect the black (or brown) wire to GND.
- Connect the yellow (or orange) wire to pin 12.

## Code

A servo motor is controlled by a PWM signal. The duty cycle of the PWM signal
determines the angle of the servo motor. The frequency of the PWM signal is
usually 50Hz, but the actual frequency depends on the motor.

Similarly to the [fading LED example](../pwm/led) we just need to create a
PWM generator and then hook pin 12 to it. This time the frequency of the
wave should be 50Hz.

Write the following `servo.toit` program and run or watch it:

```toit
import gpio
import gpio.pwm

main:
  servo := gpio.Pin 12
  generator := pwm.Pwm --frequency=50

  // Start with the half-way angle.
  channel := generator.start servo --duty_factor=0.075
  sleep --ms=1500

  // Max angle.
  channel.set_duty_factor 0.125
  sleep --ms=1500

  // Min angle.
  channel.set_duty_factor 0.025
  sleep --ms=1500
```

Servo motors only have a limited range in which they should operate: the maximum
duty factor is 0.125, and the minimum is 0.025.

If the motor is operated out of the recommended range it may use significantly
more power, trying to reach the desired angle. However, the 3.3V supply is
limited, and eventually the 5V-to-3.3V converter
(converting USB 5V to the 3.3V that are needed by the ESP32) can't deliver
anymore. At that point the voltage drops and the ESP32 detects a
[brownout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(electricity)), and shuts down.

This can be seen when running `toit monitor`:

```
entry 0x400805c8
clearing RTC memory: powered on by hardware source
[flash reg] address 0x3f430000, size 0x00200000
[jaguar] INFO: program 1 re-starting from flash @ [442368,466944]

Brownout detector was triggered
```

For programs that are installed (see
[container install](../../containers/containers)) this can be
an issue if the servo draws too much power before Jaguar is able to update
the program. In that case, one has to unplug the servo to get back into a
state where Jaguar is able to install a corrected program.

## Exercises
Be careful not to run with frequencies that aren't supported by the
servo. Furthermore keep the angle in a range that is supported by the
servo. Otherwise the motor could draw too much power leading to an
unstable system. Unless the system is stressed for a long period of
time, there should not be any permanent damage. This assumes that
the connections were made correctly.

- Use the servo as an actuator for a button (for example the space bar of
  a keyboard).
- Use the servo as a gauge showing different values.
