# Potentiometer
A potentiometer is a variable resistor with 3 terminals. A so-called "wiper"
slides over a resistive element dividing the full resistance based on its
position.

The most common potentiometer value is 10kΩ. This means that the resistance
between the outer terminals is 10kΩ. The resistance between the wiper and one
of the outer terminals is 0Ω when the wiper is at that terminal, and 10kΩ when
the wiper is at the other terminal.

## Prerequisites
You should have done the [ADC](../adc) tutorial before this one.

## Variable resistor
Before using the potentiometer together with the ESP32, let's see how it
works. Connect the potentiometer as follows:
- VCC (one of the terminals) to 3V3
- OUT (the wiper; typically in the middle) to an LED
- the LED to a 330Ω resistor
- the resistor to GND

In this case we use the ESP32 board simply as a power supply. The potentiometer
is a variable resistor, so we can use it to dim the LED. Turn the knob and see
the LED get brighter and dimmer.

In the [binary sensors tutorial](../binary) we mentioned that many
binary sensors come with a blue potentiometer to set the sensitivity. This is
how it works: the potentiometer is used as a variable resistor to set the
threshold for the sensor.

## Setup with a microcontroller
Connect the potentiometer as follows:
- GND (one of the terminals) to GND
- VCC (the other terminal) to 3V3
- OUT (the wiper) to pin 34

## Code
You can use the program from the ADC tutorial to see the voltage change when
the knob is turned.

``` toit
import gpio
import gpio.adc

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 34
  adc := adc.Adc pin
  256.repeat:
    print "$(%1.3f adc.get)"
    sleep --ms=500
```

## Exercises
In order not to damage the hardware, follow the same recommendation as
for the [ADC](../adc) tutorial:
- Only measure 5V through a voltage divider.
- Don't connect GND and 3V3/5V.
- Keep the pin 34 pin as input.

Servos are great tools for variable inputs. For example, you
can control the angle of a [servo motor](../pwm-servo) with it.
