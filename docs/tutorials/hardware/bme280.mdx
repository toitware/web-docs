# BME280 - Temperature, Humidity and Pressure Sensor
In this tutorial we are going to meausure temperature, humidity and
pressure using the BME280 sensor.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have done the [i2c](../i2c) tutorial.

We recommend to have read the [packages](../../setup/packages) tutorial,
since we are going to use a package for the BME280 driver.

## Setup

Connect the BME280 to the ESP32 as follows:
- VCC to 3V3
- GND to GND
- SCL to pin 25 (yellow on sparkfun boards)
- SDA to pin 26 (blue on sparkfun boards)

<img
  src={Bme280Schematics}
  alt="Schematics for a BME280 sensor"
/>

Make sure the device is found by executing the list program
from the [i2c](../i2c) tutorial. It should print one of the
BME280 I2C addresses: 0x76 (118) or 0x77 (119).

## Packages
The driver for the BME280 is not part of the standard Toit distribution,
but must be downloaded as package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [bme280](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Fbme280-driver@v1)
package. To install it, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/bme280-driver@v1
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install bme280`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

</Note>

## Code
Create a new file `bme280.toit` and start `jag watch bme280.toit` to run
the program whenever you save.

```toit
import gpio
import i2c
import bme280

main:
  bus := i2c.Bus
    --sda=gpio.Pin 26
    --scl=gpio.Pin 25

  // Use 'I2C_ADDRESS' if your device has address 0x76 (118).
  // Use 'I2C_ADDRESS_ALT' if your device has address 0x77 (119).
  device := bus.device bme280.I2C_ADDRESS

  driver := bme280.Driver device

  print "$driver.read_temperature C"
  print "$driver.read_pressure Pa"
  print "$driver.read_humidity %"

  driver.close
  bus.close
```

The program first instantiates an I2C bus object, which it uses to
get a handle to the device with the BME280 address. It then passes
this device to the BME280 driver. At that point the driver
configures the sensor.

When `read_temperature`, `read_pressure` and `read_huminity`
is called, the driver then requests the corresponding values
from the device. There is some computation to convert the
raw values to human understandable values, but that's hidden
by the driver.

Note that this program uses
[string interpolation](../../../language/strings#string-interpolation).
