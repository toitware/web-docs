# I2C bus
In this tutorial we are going to introduce the I2C bus and how to use it with Toit.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

While not necessary, we recommend to have a look at the [LED](../led)
tutorial to get familiar with the basics of using the GPIO pins.

## Introduction
I2C is a serial communication bus that is widely used in electronics. It
consists of a data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Multiple devices
(sensors, or more complex devices like OLED displays) can be connected
to the same bus.

Each device reacts to a hardware device ID. This ID is typically hard-wired
and can not be changed dynamically. Many sensors have a way to physically
modify the hardware to select a different "alt" ID. For example,
the [BME280](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/humidity-sensors-bme280/)
sensor has a solder jumper that can be used to select between two different
addresses.

The I2C's clock runs at a certain frequency. Originally, this frequency was
capped at 100kHz, but was then extended to 400kHz in "fast" mode. Not all
hardware supports the fast mode.

The I2C bus is a controller-target bus. This means that there is one controller
device that controls the bus. This device is typically a microcontroller, but
can also be a more powerful device like a Raspberry Pi. The controller
initiates all communication on the bus. The target devices can not initiate
communication on their own.

On the ESP32 the default pins for the I2C bus are pin 21 for SDA and pin 22
for SCL, but these can be rerouted to other pins. In our example we will use
pin 25 for SCL and pin 26 for SDA.

## Code
Without knowing which devices are connected to the I2C bus, it is not possible
to communicate with them. There is not standardized protocol to interface
with I2C devices. However, it is possible to scan for devices on the bus,
and to list their addresses.

Write an `i2c.toit` file and watch it with Jaguar:

```toit
import gpio
import i2c

main:
  scl := gpio.Pin 25
  sda := gpio.Pin 26
  frequency := 100_000

  bus := i2c.Bus --sda=sda --scl=scl --frequency=frequency

  devices := bus.scan
  devices.do: print it
```

This program will scan the I2C bus and print the addresses of all devices
that are found.

You can look through Adafruit's
[i2c-addresses list](https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-addresses/the-list)
to find out what the addresses mean.

Since I2C addresses are typically written in hexadecimal format, you
might want to change the last line of the program to the following:
```toit
  devices.do: print "0x$(%02x it)"
```

This will use a [string interpolation](../../language/strings#string-interpolation)
with the
[2-digit hexadecimal format](https://libs.toit.io/core/class-string#format(2%2C0%2C0%2C))
to print the addresses.
