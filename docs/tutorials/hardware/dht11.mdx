# DHT11
The DHT11 sensor is a cheap sensor that communicates over temperature and
humidity over one wire (in addition to power and ground).

## Prerequisites
We assume that you have set up your development environment as described
in [the IDE tutorial](../../setup/ide).

We also assume that you have flashed your device with Jaguar and that
you are familiar with running Toit programs on it.
If not, have a look at the [Hello world](../../setup/firstprogram) tutorial.

## Setup
Connect the DHT11 sensor as follows:
- Connect the sensor's VCC/+ pin to the ESP32's 3.3V pin.
- Connect the sensor's GND/- pin to the ESP32's GND pin.
- Connect the sensor's DATA/OUT/S pin to pin 32.

There are many different variants of DHT11 modules and they don't always
have the same pin-out. Be sure to check the pin-out of your module before
connecting it. We have seen multiple DHT11 sensors being destroyed
because they were connected the wrong way.

## Packages
The driver for the DHT11 is not part of the standard Toit distribution,
but must be downloaded as package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [dhtxx](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-dhtxx@v1)
(and not the "dht11") package. To install it, run the following command
in your project directory:

```bash
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-dhtxx@v1
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install dhtxx`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

</Note>

## Code
Write and Jaguar-watch the following `dht11.toit` program:

```
import dhtxx
import gpio

GPIO_PIN_NUM ::=  32

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin GPIO_PIN_NUM
  driver := dhtxx.Dht11 pin

  (Duration --ms=1000).periodic:
    print driver.read
```

This prints the temperature and humidity of the sensor every second (which is
the recommended minimum interval for the DHT11 sensor).

## Under the hood
The communication between the ESP32 and the sensor is time-sensitive.
It's thus a good idea to let the microcontroller do the work with hardware
functionality.

The dhtxx driver does this using the
[RMT (remote control)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/rmt.html)
peripheral whose primary function is to send and receive infrared remote
control signals. By holding it the right way the RMT module is, however,
also very convenient to send and receive precisely timed signals.

## Exercises
As long as the connections were done correctly you can't damage your
hardware by changing your program.

- Connect an additional LED (don't forget the resistor) and turn it on when
  the temperature reaches a certain threshold.
- Show the current temperature and humidity on a [display](../ssd1306).
