# OLED display
The SSD1306 OLED display is a cheap and popular display. It is, for
example, the display that is used on the Makerfabs ESP32 board.

In this tutorial we will write text on it, and draw some icons.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have done the [i2c](../i2c) tutorial.

We recommend to have read the [packages](../../setup/packages) tutorial,
since we are going to use a package for the SSD1306 driver.

## Setup
Connect the display to the ESP32 board as follows:
- VCC/VIN to 3V3
- GND to GND
- SCL to pin 25
- SDA to pin 26

Many boards that have an SSD1306 display integrated (like
the [Makerfabs MaESP Oled](https://www.makerfabs.com/makepython-esp32.html) or
the Wemos Lolin) have the
display connected to pins 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL). If you use one of these
boards you have to change the code below to use these pins.

The Heltec boards with integrated displays, use the following pins:
- v2: SDA=4, SCL=15
- v3: SDA=17, SCL=18

Note that we use the Adafruit 128x32 display in the following diagrams. The
connections are the same for 128x64 displays.

## Packages
The driver for the SSD1306 is not part of the standard Toit distribution,
but must be downloaded as package. See the [packages](../../setup/packages)
tutorial for details.

We are using the [ssd1306](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-ssd1306@v1)
package. To install it, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-ssd1306@v1
```

<Note>

You can probably just write `jag pkg install ssd1306`, but the full ID together
with the version is more explicit, and will make sure you get the right package.

</Note>

Similarly, install the
[pixel-display package](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-pixel-display@v1)
to provide convenience methods to draw on the display:

```bash
jag pkg install toitware/toit-pixel-display@v1
```

For information about how to use the display libraries,
see the [display documentation](../../../language/sdk/display).

In this tutorial, we are just going to show a few examples.

## Text
Start a `ssd1306_text.toit` program and watch it with Jaguar.

Enter the following program:

```toit
import font show *
import gpio
import i2c
import pixel_display show *
import pixel_display.two_color show *
import ssd1306 show *

current_date:
  now := Time.now.local
  return "$now.year-$(%02d now.month)-$(%02d now.day)"

current_time:
  now := Time.now.local
  return "$(%02d now.h):$(%02d now.m):$(%02d now.s)"

main:
  sda := gpio.Pin 26
  scl := gpio.Pin 25
  frequency := 400_000

  bus := i2c.Bus --sda=sda --scl=scl --frequency=frequency

  devices := bus.scan
  if not devices.contains Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS:
    throw "No SSD1306 display found"

  driver := Ssd1306.i2c (bus.device Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS)
  display := TwoColorPixelDisplay driver
  display.background = BLACK

  sans := Font.get "sans10"
  sans_context := display.context
      --landscape
      --font=sans
      --color=WHITE
  display.text sans_context 30 20 "Toit"
  date := display.text sans_context 30 40 ""
  time_text := display.text sans_context 30 60 ""
  while true:
    date.text = current_date
    time_text.text = current_time
    display.draw
    sleep --ms=250
```

As a first step we create an i2c bus object with:
`i2c.Bus --sda=sda --scl=scl --frequency=frequency`.
This calls the constructor of the `Bus` class, passing in the named arguments.
The display supports the "fast" mode of i2c which is why we can set the
frequency to 400KHz (and not just 100KHz). The code would work the
same way with 100KHz.

We then instantiate a `Ssd1306` object by calling its i2c constructor.
As argument it receives the i2c device with ID `Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS`.
The value of `Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS` is equal to 60, thus
identifying the display on the bus.

With the driver object we can then build a display object which
gives us some useful methods to operate the display. We can set
the background color to BLACK, and then use the WHITE constant
to write later.

Writing text is done by first finding a font (here `sans10`) and
then creating a context with it. The context can then be used for
the text function of the display.

Note that operations on the display don't immediately interact
with the physical display but build up a drawing queue/graph instead.
Only with `display.draw` is the content constructed and sent to the
physical display.

This has two major advantages. We can reuse the graph and simply
update the parts that change. In our example we have a while-true
loop that just updates the objects we received from the `display.text`
calls. We could also call `move_to` on the object to move it
somewhere.

See the documentation of the
TextTexture [here](https://pkg.toit.io/github.com/toitware/toit-pixel-display@1.6.0/docs/pixel_display/two_color/class-TextTexture)

The program writes 3 lines:
- `Toit`,
- the date in ISO 8601 format, and
- the time.

#### Time
By default the device starts with a time set to 1970. You can use the
[ntp package](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-ntp@v1.0.0)
to synchronize the device's time.

See this [example](https://github.com/toitlang/pkg-ntp/blob/master/examples/settime.toit).

## Icons
As the name implies, it is possible to draw individual pixels onto a
display. However, in many cases, icons are completely sufficient.

Toit provides a package with icons from the [Pictogrammers](https://pictogrammers.com/)
project. To use them, install the
[pictogrammers_icons](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitware%2Ftoit-icons-pictogrammers@v1):

```shell
jag pkg install github.com/toitware/toit-icons-pictogrammers@v1
```

Start a new file and save it as display_icon.toit. Use `jag watch` to
run it whenever it is saved.

Enter the following code into the new file:

```toit
import pictogrammers_icons.size_48 as icons
import gpio
import i2c
import pixel_display show *
import pixel_display.two_color show *
import ssd1306 show *

get_display -> TwoColorPixelDisplay:
  sda := gpio.Pin 26
  scl := gpio.Pin 25
  frequency := 400_000

  bus := i2c.Bus --sda=sda --scl=scl --frequency=frequency

  devices := bus.scan
  if not devices.contains Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS:
    throw "No SSD1306 display found"

  device = bus.device Ssd1306.I2C_ADDRESS
  driver := Ssd1306.i2c device
  return TwoColorPixelDisplay driver

main:
  display := get_display
  display.background = BLACK

  context := display.context --landscape --color=WHITE
  icon := display.icon context 0 50 icons.HUMAN_SCOOTER
  while true:
    80.repeat:
      icon.move_to it 50
      display.draw
      sleep --ms=1
    sleep --ms=2_000
```

The code starts again by creating the display. This time we moved
the display-creation code into its own function
(`get_display` which returns a `TwoColorPixelDisplay`).

If your display is only a 32-line display you need to add the
argument `--height=32` to the driver creation. In some cases
you also need to play with the following arguments:
- `--flip`, to flip the display vertically,
- `--inverse`, to invert black and white,
- `--layout=XXX` where `XXX` is one of `LAYOUT_SEQUENTIAL`,
  `LAYOUT_SEQUENTIAL_SWITCHED`, `LAYOUT_ALTERNATED`, or
  `LAYOUT_ALTERNATED_SWITCHED`.

As before we create a context, which we can use to add the
icon to the drawing queue. Inside the loop the
position is updated before every draw. This makes the icon move
from left to right over the display.

You can browse the icons at: https://materialdesignicons.com/.

Often, devices are used for temperature measurements, in which
case icons that start with `icons.WEATHER_` are interesting. Use
the completion to see which icons exist.

## Exercises
As long as the connections were done correctly you can't damage your
hardware by changing your program.

- Change the text.
- Fix the device's internal time before showing anything on the display.
  See the [ntp package](https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-ntp@v1)
  and the corresponding [example](https://github.com/toitlang/pkg-ntp/blob/master/examples/settime.toit).
- Invert the colors, so that the background is white and the text is black.
