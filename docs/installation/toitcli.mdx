# Install Toit

The Toit command-line interface (CLI) is used for interacting with the Toit console and your devices.

## Install the Toit CLI

<Tabs>
<div label="Install on Windows">

## Download the Toit installer

Download the <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/windows/installer" target="_blank">Toit installer for Windows</a> and follow the instructions in the installer.

## Check

Type `toit` in a terminal window.

</div>
<div label="Install on macOS">

Note that Mac users may need administrator rights to run Toit at the end of the installation process.

## Download the Toit executable

Download the <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/darwin" target="_blank">Toit executable for macOS</a>.

Unpack the `toit_darwin.tgz` file and save the executable file named `toit` to a new folder (that you can call for example `toit`) within your favorite installation folder (for example the Applications folder).

## Add Toit to your PATH

To make sure you can **run the Toit CLI in a terminal window from any directory**, add the toit executable to your PATH environment variable by editing the shell configuration script, depending on which shell you are using: open a `.zshrc` file (on Catalina) or a `.bash_profile` file (on older macOS versions) with `open ~/.zshrc` or `open ~/.bash_profile`.

Type in the shell configuration script

```shell
export PATH=/Applications/toit:$PATH
```

where `Applications/toit` is an example of where the `toit` executable is located. Save the file before closing it.

## Configure VSCODE

You also need to configure VSCode PATH on macOS. If you have not done so yet, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> and launch VS Code. In the View menu, choose to open the **Command Palette**. Type 'shell command' to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.

## Check

To verify that you successfully configured the PATH with the toit executable, type `toit` in a **new** terminal.

<Note>

Note that Mac users may get the following warning when starting Toit for the first time. Click on the **?** and follow the instructions to **Allow anyway** the toit executable

<div label="Install on Linux">

## Download the Toit executable

Download the <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/linux" target="_blank">Toit executable for Linux</a>.

When the download of the Toit CLI has completed, open the _Downloads_ folder on your computer and copy the downloaded file to your preferred installation directory.

![Downloadsfolder](../img/downloadsfolder.png)

Next, uncompress the downloaded Toit CLI, which is packed as a `tgz` file.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you copied the downloaded file to.

To unpack, run

```shell
tar x -vzf toit_linux.tgz
```

The result of unpacking the Toit CLI is an executable file, named `toit`, and the result should look like this:

![Extract](../img/extract.png)

## Add Toit to your PATH

Add the folder where the `toit` executable is located to your PATH environment variable so you can run the Toit CLI tool from any directory in a terminal. For example, add the following line to a shell script that runs before you open a terminal, such as `.bash_profile` or `rczsh` located in your home directory:

```shell
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
```

## Check

A logout/login is required for this to take effect. Reopen a terminal and type `toit` to verify that the changes have taken effect.

</div>
</Tabs>

The output of running `toit` is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

## Install the Toit SDK and the Toit language extension

Next, install the **latest released Toit SDK** on your computer by running the CLI command:

```shell
toit doctor fix
```

If you have installed Visual Studio Code as mentioned in [here](vscode.md), the command also installs the **Toit language extension for VSCode**.

The command

```shell
toit doctor
```

reports the health status of your local Toit installation. Its output should look like this:

```shell
Toit health:
  [OK] Toit SDK
  [OK] Visual Studio Code
  [OK] Toit CLI
```
