# Visual Studio Code

Toit supports you in writing Toit programs with the Toit Language Extension for Visual Studio Code.
Note that the extension is not available on VSCode Marketplace but will be installed when installing Toit as explained <Link to="../toitcli">here</Link>.

Note that while you can use another editor to write `*.toit` files, the Toit language extension is currently only supported for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.
However we do have a Language Server which works with all IDEs that support the LSP protocol.
The language server includes syntax highlighting for VIM users.
