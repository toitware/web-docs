# APIs

## GRPC API

The Toit console provides a publicly available [gRPC API](https://github.com/toitware/api) (with API packages and examples for Java, Python and NodeJS) allowing a client application to do all public operations on the Toit console.

The service is available on: `https://api.toit.io`.

The API is guarded so all requests should be authorized with `Authorization: Bearer access-token`.
with the `access-token` available using the [toit.api.Auth service](https://github.com/toitware/api/blob/master/proto/toit/api/auth.proto).

Use `toit project api-keys add <name>` to create a key that can be used to connect server applications to the API.

Then, use `toit project api-keys print-secret <api-key-ID>` to view the API key secret. This secret must be used when creating the connection in your server application,
to the Toit Cloud. See examples of how to create the connection using the API key secret in the [demo repository](https://github.com/toitware/demos/tree/master/api), where
we provide examples of API usage in four different programming languages (NodeJS, Java, Go, and Python).

## Pubsub API

The Toit console provides a [pubsub ingestion API](https://github.com/toitware/api/blob/master/proto/toit/api/data.proto). The type of data to be ingested is grouped into two groups: **Metrics** (measurement at a point in time for the system generated by the `metrics` library) and **Logs** (system generated set of data that describe an event generated by the `logs` library).

Data is collected on the device by the system process from your application code and sent to the Toit cloud where it will be grouped and available for ingestion.
