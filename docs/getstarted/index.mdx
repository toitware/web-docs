# Get started

Toit is a modern high-level language designed specifically for microcontrollers. It is [open source](https://github.com/toitlang/toit) and the
language implementation consists of the compiler, virtual machine, and standard libraries that together enable Toit programs to run on an ESP32.

Toit is optimized for live reloading on your microcontroller. Your code runs incrementally as you write it and you get instant feedback. Push
changes over your local WiFi in two seconds and reserve your USB cable for charging your phone. You iterate quickly, learn fast, and build
better things.

## Architecture

Toit uses virtual machine technology to support running multiple containers on your device. The containers are developed and maintained
independently from each other and the virtual machine provides the capabilities for safely running your platform-independent applications,
services, and drivers side-by-side.

This architecture provides a lot of flexibility and it allows you to customize the functionality of your devices by choosing the
right services and containers to run instead of re-compiling and re-linking.

## Development

Toit comes with pre-packaged development support that makes experimenting and learning by running code on your device
easy. You change your code in your editor, update it on your device, and restart it all within seconds. No need to flash over serial,
reboot your device, or wait for it to reconnect to your network. It only takes a few minutes to [get started](device).

Under the covers, the development support is provided by [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) &mdash; a small, open-source Toit
service that runs in a container on your ESP32. It uses the capabilities of the Toit virtual machine to let you update and restart
your code through an HTTP server that runs on the device and is accessed via local WiFi. Jaguar is completely optional and it intended
to be used during development only, so it is typically left out on devices in production.

## Deployment

When you are ready to run your devices in production, you can rely on the Toit virtual machine's support for over-the-air (OTA) firmware
updates. You choose when and where to download the updates from and the updates can bundle any number of containers, so all your applications
and services can be kept up-to-date through the OTA mechanism. [Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) is an excellent
[source of inspiration](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/blob/36252dc369979062713b0807b5eca309e12a9784/src/jaguar.toit#L303) for how to
use the OTA support from your own applications.

If you're looking for a more managed solution for your fleet of devices, Toit offers premium, pre-packaged deployment support
through the [Artemis](fleet). Artemis is a fleet management infrastructure that connects your devices to the cloud and
makes it possible to seamlessly update the firmware, containers, and configurations that run on your devices. It is free for
up to ten devices and built to scale.

</Note>

Artemis is the combination of an on-device service that communicates with a broker in the cloud &mdash; and the developer tooling to help
orchestrate the devices. Hosting your own broker is possible and encouraged, so all your data and code remains under your control. Since
Artemis runs in its own container on your devices, it is easy to add Artemis to already deployed devices and remove it again later.
