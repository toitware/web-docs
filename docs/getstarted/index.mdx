# Quick start guide

This guide shows how to sign up with Toit, install the Toit firmware on your [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32),
setup your local development environment, and finally how to deploy a Toit app on your ESP32 over-the-air.

## 1. Get an ESP32

If you already have an ESP32 available, jump to step 2 to continue. Otherwise, you can buy one at [digikey](https://www.digikey.com), or
any other electronics distributor. Any board that contains a standard ESP32 chip (like the WROOM or WROVER) should be fine.
If you have doubts, don't hesitate to ask for guidance on our [Discord](https://discord.com/embed/invite/Q7Y9VQ5nh2) channel.

## 2. Install Jaguar

The following describes how to install a precompiled version of Jaguar,
including a prebuilt ROM image that is suitable for most ESP32s.  If you need to
build from source, see the instructions at [Github](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/).


<Tabs>
<Tab label="Windows">

On Windows 10+ simply open powershell, and run:
```shell
winget install --id=Toit.Jaguar -e
```

For older Windows versions, download and install Jaguar from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_installer.exe).

</Tab>
<Tab label="macOS">

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Jaguar as follows:
```shell
brew install toitlang/toit/jag
```

Or you can download and install Jaguar manually from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag.dmg).

</Tab>

<Tab label="Linux">

On Archlinux there is an AUR package, which can be installed with:

```shell
yay install jaguar-bin
```

A precompiled binary can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_linux.tgz).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Run the command `jag setup` after installation to finish the setup of Jaguar. This step downloads
the [Toit SDK](https://github.com/toitlang/toit) and an ESP32 image.

## 3. Flash

Connect your ESP32 to a serial port and run `jag flash`.

Having issues? Get help in the [troubleshoot](../../support/troubleshoot) section, or contact us in
our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Q7Y9VQ5nh2) channel. We have some experience with flashing,
and are happy to help.

## 4. Run code

Create a file `hello.toit` with the following content:

```
// Save as hello.toit
main:
  while true:
    print "Hello, World!"
    sleep --ms=3000
```

Run it with `jag run hello.toit`.

At this stage you won't see anything, as the output is emitted to the serial output.

Use `jag monitor --attach` to start listening to the serial output. The `--attach` flag
is to make sure we don't reboot the device.

You should start seeing the "Hello, World!" messages printed out.

## 5. Install a container

With `jag run` a program is only run once, and disappears when the device is rebooted.

Use `jag container install hello hello.toit` to install the program as a container. After this the
program will be rerun every time the device reboots.

## 6. Install Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit),
which significantly improves development of Toit code.

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) first. Then open the extensions menu and search for
"Toit".

## 7. What's next?

Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing IoT applications using Toit. Next step, look in the [tutorials](../../tutorials) or dive into the [Toit language guide](../../language).
