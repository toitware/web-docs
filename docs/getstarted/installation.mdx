# Installation

## Prerequisite

Before you can start writing Toit apps and deploy them on your hardware, you need to install the Toit command-line interface (CLI) locally on your computer.

The Toit CLI is used for interacting with the Toit console and your hardware.

## Optional

Toit comes with a language server, which works with most modern editors. However, we recommend to use
the Toit Language Extension for Visual Studio Code as it is the most tested, and has more features. You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install the Toit CLI

<Tabs>
<div label="Install on Windows">

## Download the Toit installer

Download the
[Toit installer for Windows](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/windows/installer)
and follow the instructions in the installer.

## Check

Type `toit` in a terminal window.

</div>
<div label="Install on macOS">

<Note>

Mac users may need administrator rights to run `toit` at the end of the installation process.

</Note>

## Download the Toit executable

Download the
[Toit executable for macOS](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/darwin).

Unpack the `toit_darwin.tgz` file and save the executable file named `toit` to a new folder (for example the `Applications` folder).

## Add Toit to your PATH

To make sure you can **run the Toit CLI in a terminal window from any directory**, add the toit executable to your PATH environment variable 
by editing the shell configuration script. 

Depending on which shell you are using: open a `.zshrc` file or a `.bash_profile` file with 

```shell
open ~/.zshrc
```

or 

```shell
open ~/.bash_profile
```

Type in the shell configuration script

```shell
export PATH=/Applications/mytoitfolder:$PATH
```

where `Applications/mytoitfolder` is an example of where the `toit` executable is located. Save the file before closing it.

## Configure VSCode

You also need to configure VSCode PATH on macOS. If you have not done so yet,
download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and
launch VS Code. In the View menu, choose to open the **Command Palette**. Type
'shell command' to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.

## Check

To verify that you successfully configured the PATH with the `toit` executable, type `toit` in a **new** terminal window.

<Note>

Mac users may get the following warning when starting `toit` the first time. Click on the **?** and follow the instructions to find the **Allow anyway** button that allows you to run the `toit` executable

## Download the Toit executable

Download the
[Toit executable for Linux](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/linux).

When the download of the Toit CLI has completed, open the `Downloads` folder on your computer and copy the downloaded file to your preferred installation directory.

Next, uncompress the downloaded Toit CLI, which is packed as a `tgz` file.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you copied the downloaded file to.

To unpack, run

```shell
tar x -vzf toit_linux.tgz
```

The result of unpacking the Toit CLI is an executable file, named `toit`, and the result should look like this:

## Add Toit to your PATH

Add the folder where the `toit` executable is located to your PATH environment variable so you can run the Toit CLI tool from any directory in a terminal. 
For example, add the following line to a shell script that runs before you open a terminal, such as `.bash_profile` or `rczsh` located in your home directory:

```shell
export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
```

## Check

A logout/login is required for this to take effect. Reopen a terminal and type `toit` to verify that the changes have taken effect.

</div>
</Tabs>

The output of running

```shell
toit
```

in a terminal window is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

## Install the Toit SDK and the Toit language extension

Next, install the **latest released Toit SDK** on your computer by running the CLI command:

```shell
toit doctor fix
```

If you have installed Visual Studio Code, the same command also installs the **Toit language extension for VSCode**.

The command

```shell
toit doctor
```

reports the health status of your local Toit installation. Its output should look like this:

```txt
Toit health:
  [OK] Toit SDK
  [OK] Visual Studio Code
  [OK] Toit CLI
```

<Note title="Toit Language Extension"> 

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.
