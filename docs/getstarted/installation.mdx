### Download the Toit executable

Download the
[Toit executable for macOS](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/darwin).

Unpack the `toit_darwin.tgz` file and save the executable file named `toit` into a folder - for example the `Applications` folder.

### Add Toit to your PATH

To make sure you can run the Toit CLI in a terminal window from any directory, add the Toit executable to your PATH environment variable
by editing the shell configuration script.

Depending on the shell you use: edit either the `.zshrc` file or the `.bashrc` file.

For example, if you use `bash` and if you chose to put the `toit` executable into the `Applications` folder,
execute the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=/Applications:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc;
```

### Check

To verify that you successfully configured the PATH with the `toit` executable, type `toit` in a **new** terminal window.

<Note>

Mac users may get the following warning when starting `toit` the first time. Click on the **?** and follow the instructions to find the **Allow anyway** button that allows you to run the `toit` executable

### Add Toit to your PATH

Add the folder where the `toit` executable is located to your PATH environment variable, so you can run the Toit CLI from any directory in a terminal window.

Depending on the shell you use: edit either the `.rczsh` file or the `.bashrc` file, located in your home directory.

For example, if you use `bash` and if you chose to put the `toit` executable into the `$HOME/local/bin` folder,
execute the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc;
```

### Check

Reopen a terminal window and type `toit` to verify that the changes have taken effect.

The output of running

```shell

in a terminal window is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

## Install the Toit SDK

Install the latest released [Toit SDK](../../language/sdk/sdk) on your computer by running the CLI command:

```shell
toit doctor fix
```

## Toit doctor

The command

```shell
