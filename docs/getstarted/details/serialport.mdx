# Serial port troubleshooting

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

The Toit CLI offers commands to help you connect your ESP32 via a serial connection.

Start by connecting your ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer.

List the serial ports currently in use on your computer by running the following command with the Toit CLI in a terminal window:

```shell
toit serial ports
```

For example, if exactly one serial port, called `COM3`, is currently in use, the output of the command will look like this

```txt
$ toit serial ports
COM3
```

You can monitor the serial output of the ESP32 with the command

```shell
toit serial monitor
```

The `monitor` command can be stopped by `Ctrl+c`

If you have already initially provisioned your ESP32, run the following CLI command to read the hardware information via serial output:

```shell
toit serial info
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

In the [Web Serial](https://console.toit.io/serial) page in the Toit console, the serial port dialog will list the serial ports that are open.

## Install USB driver

If you have previously connected your ESP32 via a serial connection to your computer, for example using Arduino IDE, you probably do not need to update the USB driver on your computer.

Otherwise, if you are using macOS or Windows, you might need to install or update the following USB driver on your computer:

1. The USB to UART Bridge VCP driver from
   [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

For Windows, install the CP210x Universal Windows Driver.
For macOS, install the CP210x VCP Mac OSX Driver.

Install the driver, _reboot your computer_ and you are ready to talk to your ESP32 via a serial port.

## Troubleshooting serial port connections

If you have trouble connecting your ESP32 device with your computer via a serial connection

- try updating the USB driver. If you are using Windows or macOS, make sure your drivers are up to date (install from [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)).

- try a different serial port on your computer and run the `toit serial ports` CLI command again to detect the correct serial port to use in the commands.

- try to disconnect all other serial connections, if any, from your computer, to be sure to only have the ESP32 connected to your computer as the only one.

- if you use the Toit CLI, remember to close the browser window if you have tried to create a serial connection in the browser via https://console.toit.io/serial first.

- try to plug in the hardware with a USB cable directly into your computer instead of using a USB hub in between.

- if you are on Linux, make sure you are in the `dialout` group as explained [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#adding-user-to-dialout-on-linux).

- be sure to use the correct type of USB cable to connect with when provisioning your ESP32, in other words a cable for both data and power, and not only for power usage.

- set the default serial port to be used in the serial CLI commands with `toit serial port use my-port` (and replace `my-port` with the actual port name) in order to avoid mistakes when talking with your device on a serial connection.

<Note title="Device connections">

When the ESP32 has been initially provisioned with WiFi credentials, the ESP32 device is connecting to the network via WiFi, and the serial connection is purely for debugging the device if WiFi connection is lost.
In other words, you can plug the ESP32 into another power source and communicate with the ESP32 over WiFi from now on.
Later on you can always add other connection types, like cellular connection.

</Note>

## Troubleshooting the provisioning of an ESP32

Some hardware models need physical interaction with the device during initial provisioning - like pushing a button.
If provisioning doesn't work, consult the documentation for your ESP32.

- if you have timeout problems when provisioning, some hardware models require you to [hold down BOOT button](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-failed-to-connect-to-esp32-timed-out-waiting-for-packet-header/).
  Read more info about the bootloader mode [here](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/wiki/ESP32-Boot-Mode-Selection).

- if your device wasn't able to connect via WiFi to the Toit cloud during the provisioning, it is not yet claimed. In this state the device is provisioned with the Toit firmware,
  but is not yet linked to your Toit project. Follow the instructions [here](../claim) to manually claim the device once it has managed to go
  online.

- if the provision command fails during the first part of the provisioning process, the hardware ID (if any) is written to the local disk if possible and will be reused the next time the command is executed on the same computer.

- if the provision command fails, consider trying with a lower baud rate (here half the default baud rate):

```shell
toit serial provision --baud 460800 -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

## Troubleshooting an unreachable device

If your ESP32 is misconfigured in any way, for example if it does not have valid WiFi connection settings, reinstall the ESP32 with the Toit firmware
and WiFi settings via a serial connection, by connecting it with a USB cable to your computer.

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Console">

In the [Web Serial](https://console.toit.io/serial) page in the Toit console, press the Reinstall button and provide the WiFi credentials for the WiFi currently available.

</Tab>

<Tab label="CLI">

Run the `toit serial reinstall` CLI command
with the appropriate WiFi connection settings provided (replace `MY_SSID` and `my_password` with the correct WiFi credentials):

```shell
toit serial reinstall -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

This will reinstall the Toit firmware and settings via the serial port without changing its hardware certificate or hardware ID.
