# Provision your hardware

Before you can start interacting with your hardware in the Toit console, it must be provisioned and claimed,
as described in the [quick start](../../quick_start) guide.

Provisioning means that the hardware is being granted a hardware ID used for the remaining of its lifecycle,
and the latest released Toit firmware will be installed on the hardware. Initial WiFi settings must be provided and
if your hardware can get online during provisioning it will get a name and will connect to the Toit cloud where you
can access it from your organization.
Additional connection settings can be added or changed later on.

You need the Toit CLI to complete the provisioning steps below.
If you haven't installed Toit on your computer yet, follow the steps described [here](../../installation).

<Note type="warning">

Use the provision command only once per hardware device.

</Note>

Follow the steps to initially provision your device:

1. Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer where the Toit CLI is installed.

<Note type="warning" title="Install drivers!">

If you are using macOS or Windows, you might need to install or update the USB drivers if you have problems with the serial connection.

Links to drivers can be found [here](../serialport#install-drivers).

</Note>

List the serial ports currently in use on your computer by running the following command with the Toit CLI

```shell
toit serial ports
```

To avoid mistakes when talking with your device on a serial connection, set the default serial port to be used in the CLI with

```shell
toit serial port use <port>
```

2. Use the Toit CLI to provision your ESP32 with initial device settings and the latest released Toit firmware.
Replace `<SSID>` and `<password>` with your own WiFi credentials in the following command:

```shell
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid="<SSID>" -p wifi.password="<password>"
```

The WiFi settings for your ESP32 can be changed later on.

The provision commands automatically claims the device into your organization,
thereby linking it with your Toit account.

3. The provision process might take up to 5 minutes. When finished, it will output the following information:

<Note title="Troubleshooting">

If you have trouble connecting your ESP32 via a serial port to your computer please visit the [troubleshooting](../serialport) page.

</Note>

## Device models

The `provision` command sets the model on the device. The default model is `esp32-4mb`.

If you want to use another device model, you can provide it with `-m` in the provision command:

```shell
toit serial provision -m <model> -p wifi.ssid="<SSID>" -p wifi.password="<password>"
```

Look for available device models for each firmware version available in the
[Toit console](https://console.toit.io/organization/firmware).
