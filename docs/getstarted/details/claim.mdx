# Manually claim hardware

All devices must be claimed in order to be visible in the [Devices list](https://console.toit.io/devices) in the Toit console.

When a device has been claimed, it belongs to a Toit project. Only users that have access to the given Toit project can communicate with the device via the Toit cloud.

Usually, devices are claimed automatically as part of the initial [provisioning](../provision) step.
If the device wasn't able to connect via WiFi to the Toit cloud during provisioning, then the device needs to be claimed manually when the device can go online via WiFi.

## Get the hardware ID

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Console">

Connect the ESP32 to a computer with a USB cable. It requires 3.3V voltage.

Open the [serial page](https://console.toit.io/serial) in the Toit console, and click the button to connect the ESP32 via the web serial interface.

If the ESP32 has been provisioned, but not claimed yet, the hardware ID is printed at the top of the page.

</Tab>
<Tab label="CLI">

Connect the ESP32 to a computer with a USB cable. It requires 3.3V voltage.

To get the hardware ID of your device, run the following command with the Toit CLI

```shell
toit serial info
```

The output confirms that the ESP32 is provisioned by printing its hardware ID:

```txt
{
	"name": "7555c528-9eb9-48d1-a93d-42b4f246f442.359.2020-11-10.device.toitware.com",
	"model": "esp32-4mb",
	"hardware_id": "7555c528-9eb9-48d1-a93d-42b4f246f442"
}
```

Note that in cases where the ESP32 is unprovisioned, the command does not terminate.
Therefore, if the command takes more than 5 seconds to print the device's information, you must provision the device as explained in the [provisioning](../provision) section.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Get ESP32 online

The ESP32 must be connected to the internet via WiFi before you can claim it into your project. Start by ensuring that the correct WiFi credentials were provided during provisioning.

You can use the Monitor command to verify whether the ESP32 tries to connect to the Toit console via WiFi.

If this fails, add the correct WiFi credentials again using the Reinstall command.

Also, if the WiFi connection is unstable, the claim step might fail, so try to use another WiFi, if possible.

## Claim ESP32

Follow the steps to claim the ESP32 into your project:

1. Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer.

2. Get the hardware ID of the ESP32 to be claimed (as described above).

3. Navigate to the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/), and click the "Claim" button in the upper right corner. In the "Claim new" tab, enter the hardware ID of the ESP32 you want to claim.
   An optional device name can be provided. If left blank, a random name will be assigned to your ESP32.

4. Click Claim. The device is assigned a device ID.

5. The device has now been claimed by your project, and can be viewed in the devices list from the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/devices).
