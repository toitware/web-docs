# Types of hardware

Toit runs on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) chip from Espressif. We have chosen the ESP32 because it offers the best price/performance out of all the MCUs.
The ESP32 has 520 kB RAM, built-in WiFi, and 34 pins for peripherals configurable to be used for communication protocols (SPI, I<sup>2</sup>C), analog/digital interfacing (ADC/DAC), Ethernet, and much more. Its deep-sleep mode allows for extremely low power usage, making it possible to run with two AA batteries for years.

If you don't have an ESP32 yet, you can buy one [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990).

## What you need

- An ESP32 dev board

- USB cable - USB A / micro USB B

- A computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS

- A [Toit account](https://auth.toit.io/signup)

- The Toit CLI installed on your computer

## ESP32 prerequisites

In order to install Toit on an ESP32 microcontroller, it must include at least 4MB of flash and support the following features:

- WiFi to enable the initial connection to the Toit cloud

- UART to transmit and receive serial data

<Note type="warning" title="Limitations">

The ESP32 cannot connect to 5GHz WiFi network.
