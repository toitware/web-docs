# Run on your device

This short guide shows how to install Toit, flash the Toit firmware on your [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32),
setup your local development environment, and finally deploy a Toit application on your ESP32 over-the-air.

It uses the open-source Jaguar service to enable live reloading when developing for the ESP32. You
can watch a short video that shows how you can experience Jaguar on your ESP32 in two minutes:

Ready to try this yourself?


## 1. Get an ESP32

If you already have an ESP32 available, jump to step 2 to continue. Otherwise, you can buy one at [digikey](https://www.digikey.com), or
any other electronics distributor. Any board that contains a standard ESP32 chip (like the WROOM or WROVER) should be fine.
If you have doubts, don't hesitate to ask for guidance on our [Discord chat](https://chat.toit.io/).


## 2. Install Jaguar

[Jaguar](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar) is a small, open-source Toit application that runs on your ESP32. It comes
with command line tooling to make it easy to tinker with Toit code on your device.

The following describes how to install a precompiled version of Jaguar,
including a prebuilt firmware image that is suitable for most ESP32s.  If you need to
build from source, see the instructions at [GitHub](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar).

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Windows">

On Windows 10+ simply open powershell, and run:
```shell
winget install --id=Toit.Jaguar -e
```

For older Windows versions, download and install Jaguar from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_installer.exe).

</Tab>
<Tab label="macOS">

You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Jaguar as follows:
```shell
brew install toitlang/toit/jag
```

Or you can download and install Jaguar manually from
[here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag.dmg).

</Tab>

<Tab label="Linux">

On Archlinux there is an AUR package, which can be installed with:

```shell
yay install jaguar-bin
```

Or download the precompiled binary from [here](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar/releases/latest/download/jag_linux.tgz).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Run the command `jag setup` after installation to finish the setup of Jaguar. This step downloads
the [Toit SDK](https://github.com/toitlang/toit) and the suitable firmware images.


## 3. Flash your device

Now it is time to connect your ESP32 with a serial cable to your computer and put the Jaguar
application onto it. Running `jag flash` will ask you for the serial port to use and the WiFi
credentials, but be aware that the tooling requires
[permission to access your serial port](https://github.com/toitlang/jaguar#permission-to-access-serial-port).

``` sh
jag flash
```

If you want to avoid typing the WiFi credentials every time you flash, you can store
them in Jaguar's config file with:

``` sh
jag config wifi set --wifi-ssid SSID --wifi-password PASSWORD
```

After flashing, your device boots up and starts the Toit virtual machine. The Jaguar service on
the device starts a small HTTP server that listens for incoming requests. You can follow along
by monitoring the serial output of the device:

``` sh
jag monitor
```

Once the serial output shows that your ESP32 runs the Jaguar application, it will start announcing
its presence to the network using UDP broadcast. You can find a device by scanning, but this requires
you to be on the same local network as your ESP32:

``` sh
jag scan
```

Having issues? Get help in the [support](../../support) section, or contact us in
our [Discord chat](https://chat.toit.io/). We have some experience with flashing devices,
and we are happy to help.


## 4. Run code via WiFi

With the scanning complete, you're ready to run your first Toit program on your Jaguar-enabled
ESP32 device. Create a file `hello.toit` with the following content:

```
// Save as hello.toit
main:
  while true:
    print "Hello, World!"
    sleep --ms=3000
```

and then run it using:

``` sh
jag run hello.toit
```

At this stage you won't see anything unless you're still monitoring the serial output
(normally connected to your computer via USB). Use `jag monitor --attach` to start
listening to the serial output. The `--attach` flag is to make sure we don't reboot
the device. You should start seeing the "Hello, World!" messages printed out.

Jaguar also has a convenient feature where it keeps watching your Toit code on disk
and *live reloads* it whenever the file changes. Simply write:

``` sh
jag watch hello.toit
```

and edit `hello.toit` or any of the files it depends on in your favorite editor.


## 5. Install a container

With `jag run` a program is only run once, and disappears when the device is rebooted. Jaguar supports
installing named containers that are automatically run when the system boots. They can be used
to provide services and implement drivers for peripherals. The services and drivers can be used by
applications and as such they form an instrumental part of the extensibility of a Jaguar based system.

To install the `hello.toit` program as a container, use:

``` sh
jag container install hello hello.toit
```

After this the program is also run every time the device reboots. You can also list the currently installed
containers on a device through:

``` sh
jag container list
```

This results in a list that shows the container image ids and the associated names.

```
$ jag container list
85c64060-ffbd-5e04-a0dd-252d5bbf4a32: hello
4e9a12bc-7f07-5118-9f04-8ad2bbe476d1: jaguar
```


## 6. Install Visual Studio Code

The Toit SDK used by Jaguar comes with support for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
Once installed, you can add the [Toit language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit)
and get full language support for Toit, including syntax highlighting, integrated static analysis, and code completions.
Jaguar already comes with everything you need, so if you can run `jag` from your `PATH`, the extension will automatically
find the Toit SDK downloaded by Jaguar and use that.


## 7. What's next?

Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing applications using Toit. Next step, look in the [tutorials](../../tutorials) or
dive into the [Toit language guide](../../language). If you want to orchestrate your devices through the cloud, you can use [Artemis](fleet)
to safely and scalably manage their firmware, containers, and configurations with ease.
