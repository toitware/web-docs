# Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a language server, which works with most modern editors. However, we recommend to use
the Toit Language Extension for Visual Studio Code as it is the most tested, and has more features. 

You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install language extension for Toit

When you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code, get the language extension for Toit from the Visual Studio [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit).

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.

<Note title="Configure VSCode on macOS">

On macOS, you need to configure the VSCode PATH. 
Start by launching Visual Studio Code. In the View menu, choose to open the **Command Palette**. 

Type `shell command` to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.
