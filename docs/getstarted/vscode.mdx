# Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a language server and provides a Visual Studio Code Language Extension for the Toit programming language.

You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.

## Install language extension

When you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code, get the language extension for Toit either from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit)
or from the [open marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/toit/toit).

The Toit Language Extension provides built-in language support for the Toit programming languages, but also a new device view, and a serial view from where you
can interact directly with your devices. The Toit language extension also provides helpful commands for the developer, such that you can run or deploy Toit programs on
your devices directly from Visual Studio Code.

<Note title="Configure VSCode on macOS">

On macOS, you need to configure the VSCode PATH.
Start by launching Visual Studio Code. In the View menu, choose to open the **Command Palette**.

Type `shell command` to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.

</Note>


## Troubleshooting
<Tabs>
<Tab label="Windows">

#### Error: "Couldn't start client Language Server"
Make sure `toit` is in your path. When you [install](../installation) `toit` make sure to check "Add the Toit CLI application directory to your PATH variable".

Restart VSCode (reloading the window is not enough).

To check whether `toit` is found in VSCode, open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl+`) and run
```shell
toit
```
The result should be a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

#### Error: "The Language Server is not responding. Consult the documentation"
When prompted by Windows Defender, allow the LSP client access to the network.
