# Toit for Linux

## Install the Toit CLI

The Toit CLI is used for interacting with the Toit console and your Toit devices.

### Download

- Download the [Toit executable for Linux](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/linux).

- Move the downloaded file to your preferred installation directory.

- Uncompress the downloaded `tgz`-file that contains the Toit CLI.

- Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you uncompressed the Toit CLI.

To unpack the Toit CLI, run

```shell
tar x -vzf toit_linux.tgz
```

The result of unpacking the Toit CLI is an executable file, named `toit`:

### Add Toit to PATH

Add the **folder** where the `toit` executable is located to your PATH environment variable, so that you can run the Toit CLI in a terminal window from any directory.

Depending on the shell you use: edit either the `.rczsh` file or the `.bashrc` file located in your _home_ directory.

For example, if you use `bash` and if you chose to put the `toit` executable into the `$HOME/local/bin` folder,
execute the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc;
```

### Check installation

Open a new terminal window and type

```shell
toit
```

to verify that the changes have taken effect. The output is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a language server and provides a Visual Studio Code Language Extension for the Toit programming language.

You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install language extension

The Toit Language Extension provides built-in language support for the Toit programming language, but also a device view and a serial view from where you
can interact directly with your devices.

The Toit language extension also provides helpful commands for the developer, such that you can run or deploy Toit programs on
your devices directly from Visual Studio Code.

When you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code, get the language extension for Toit either from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit)
or from the [open marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/toit/toit).

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.
