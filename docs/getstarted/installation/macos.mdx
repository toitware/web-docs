# Toit for macOS

## Install the Toit CLI

The Toit CLI is used for interacting with the Toit console and your Toit devices.

### Download

- Download the
  [Toit executable for macOS](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/darwin).

- Unpack the `toit_darwin.tgz` file and save the executable file named `toit` into a folder - for example the `Applications` folder.

Watch the installation video on YouTube, if you need guidance.

### Add Toit to PATH

To make sure you can run the Toit CLI in a terminal window from any directory, add the Toit executable to your PATH environment variable
by editing the shell configuration script.

Depending on the shell you use: edit either the `.zshrc` file or the `.bashrc` file.

For example, if you use `bash` and if you chose to put the `toit` executable into the `Applications` folder,
execute the following command in a terminal window:

```shell
echo 'export PATH=/Applications:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc;
```

### Check installation

To verify that you have successfully configured the PATH with the `toit` executable, open a new terminal window and type

```shell
toit
```

The output is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

<Note>

You may need administrator rights to run `toit` at the end of the installation process.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a language server and provides a Visual Studio Code Language Extension for the Toit programming language.

You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install language extension

The Toit Language Extension provides built-in language support for the Toit programming language, but also a device view and a serial view from where you
can interact directly with your devices.

The Toit language extension also provides helpful commands for the developer, such that you can run or deploy Toit programs on
your devices directly from Visual Studio Code.

When you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code, get the language extension for Toit either from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit)
or from the [open marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/toit/toit).

<Note title="Configure VSCode">

On macOS, you need to configure the VSCode PATH in Visual Studio Code.

Start by launching Visual Studio Code. In the View menu, choose to open the **Command Palette**.

Type `shell command` to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.

</Note>

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.
