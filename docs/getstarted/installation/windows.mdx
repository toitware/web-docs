# Toit for Windows

## Install the Toit CLI

The Toit CLI is used for interacting with the Toit console and your Toit devices.

### Download

Download the
[Toit installer for Windows](https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/windows/installer)
and follow the instructions in the installer.

### Check installation

Open a terminal window and type

```shell
toit
```

The output is a list of all available commands in the Toit CLI.

## Visual Studio Code

Toit comes with a language server and provides a Visual Studio Code Language Extension for the Toit programming language.

You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install language extension

The Toit Language Extension provides built-in language support for the Toit programming language, but also a device view and a serial view from where you
can interact directly with your devices.

The Toit language extension also provides helpful commands for the developer, such that you can run or deploy Toit programs on
your devices directly from Visual Studio Code.

When you have downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code, get the language extension for Toit either from the [Visual Studio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit)
or from the [open marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/toit/toit).

The Toit Language Extension is currently only supported for Visual Studio Code.
