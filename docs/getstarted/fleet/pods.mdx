# Pods

Artemis allows you to build and distribute pods (as in a pod of whales or pea pod).
A pod is a group of containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a
description of how to run the containers. Pods are built from declarative specifications
and they form the basis of Artemis' synchronization mechanisms.


## Specifications

You can find an example pod specification file in
[specification.json](https://github.com/toitware/artemis-releases/blob/main/examples/specification.json).
It is in JSON format and looks similar to this:

```
{
  "version": 1,
  "sdk-version": "v2.0.0-alpha.79",
  "artemis-version": "v0.5.2",
  "max-offline": "0s",
  "connections": [
    {
      "type": "wifi",
      "ssid": "YOUR WIFI SSID",
      "password": "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"
    }
  ],
  "containers": {
    "hello": {
      "entrypoint": "hello.toit"
    },
    "solar": {
      "entrypoint": "examples/solar_example.toit",
      "git": "https://github.com/toitware/toit-solar-position.git",
      "branch": "v0.0.3"
    }
  }
}
```

The three version entries are for the specification format (always `1` for now) and the
SDK and Artemis versions. Be aware that not all combinations of those are supported and
use `artemis sdk list` to see the valid combinations.

The `max-offline` entry is optional and defaults to 0s. Use it to control for how
long your device is allowed to stay offline.

The `connections` section contains a prioritized list of ways to connect to the
Internet. You can have multiple `wifi` entries and Artemis will attempt to
connect to them in the specified order.

It is also possible to have `cellular` entries in `connections`, but for that to
work you'll need to have a cellular driver installed as one of your containers.
You can find a few drivers in the [cellular package](https://github.com/toitware/cellular).

The `containers` section contains named entries for the containers
you want on your device. The containers that are built from source
code have an `entrypoint` that refers to the file that has the
`main` method. You can optionally pull the source code directly
from git using `git` and `branch`.

If your container is a driver or provides services for other
containers, you probably want to start it on boot and let it
run until no other container runs. For that to work, you can
make it a background container that is automatically terminated
when the device goes to sleep like this:

```
"containers": {
  "cellular": {
    "entrypoint": "src/modules/sequans/monarch.toit",
    "git": "https://github.com/toitware/cellular.git",
    "branch": "v2.0.2",
    "background": true,
    "critical": true
  }
}
```

The `critical` flag makes the container run continuously. If you want your container
to run periodically, you can specify interval triggers in the `containers` section
like this:

```
"containers": {
  "measure": {
    "entrypoint": "measure.toit",
    "triggers": [ { "interval": "20s" } ]
  }
}
```
