# Device groups

Artemis allows you to organize your devices in groups. Each group has an
associated remote pod reference. This allows Artemis to determine which
pod a device is supposed to run.

Device groups are defined in the `fleet.json` file:

```
{
  ...
  "groups": {
    "office": {
      "pod": "esp32-wifi@v1.0.3"
    },
    "solar-farm-fr-nce": {
      "pod": "esp32s3-cellular@v1.0.3"
    }
  }
}
```

When flashing a device, you can decide which group the device belongs
to by using the `--group` argument:

``` sh
artemis serial flash --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --group office
```

From this point forward, the device knows which group it belongs to
so if the pod of its group is changed, Artemis will push an update
to the device when requested to update the fleet:

``` sh
artemis fleet update
```

## Homogenous fleets

If the `fleet.json` file contains a group named `default`, it is used
for any device where you do not specify its group when you flash it.

This is convenient for small homogenous fleets where not having to
worry about groups at all simplifies things.
