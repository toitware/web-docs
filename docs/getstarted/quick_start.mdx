# Quick start guide

This guide will show you how to sign up with Toit, setup your local development environment, install the Toit firmware on your [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32)
, and finally how to deploy a Toit app on your ESP32.

## 1. Sign up

At [toit.io](https://toit.io/), click the **Start Now** button to create a free Toit account.

## 2. Install Toit

Download the Toit command-line interface (CLI) [here](../download).

On macOS and Linux, put the Toit CLI manually to PATH (see step-by-step instructions [here](../installation)). On Windows, the Toit CLI is automatically added to PATH by the installer.

## 3. Get an ESP32

If you already have an ESP32 available, jump to step 4 to continue.

Otherwise, you can buy one [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990).

<Tabs>

<Tab label="CLI">

In the meantime, you can start a **Toit simulator** from the Toit CLI with:

```shell
toit simulator start
```

Then, jump to step 5 to continue.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

In the meantime, you can start a **Toit simulator** from the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) by clicking the "Start simulator" button.

Then, jump to step 5 to continue.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4. Provision your ESP32

To install the latest Toit firmware on your ESP32, connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Open a terminal window, and replace `MY_SSID` and `my_password` with your own WiFi credentials and run the Toit CLI command to initially
provision your hardware with the Toit firmware and WiFi settings:

```shell
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid="MY_SSID" -p wifi.password="my_password"
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

Go to the Serial page in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/serial) to initially provision your hardware with the Toit firmware and WiFi settings -
note that it only works in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Troubleshoot">

Having issues? See the detailed descriptions in the [provision page](../details/provision) or get help in the [troubleshooting](../troubleshoot) section.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

At the end of the provisioning process, you will receive the name of the device, and a URL to view the device in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/).
When your device is online, all device communication will be **over-the-air**.

Your device has now been added to your Toit project. Only users with access to the same Toit project can communicate with the device via the Toit cloud.

## 5. Write a Toit app

You can either **run** a Toit program once on your ESP32 or **deploy** the same Toit program as a long-lived application.

First, create a project folder and save the following Toit code in a file named `hello.toit` using Visual Studio Code.

```
// Save as hello.toit
main:
  print "Hello, World!"
```

Save the following yaml code in a file named `hello.yaml` and place it in the same folder as the `hello.toit` file from above:

```yaml
# Save as hello.yaml
name: "HelloApp"
entrypoint: hello.toit
triggers:
  on_boot: true
  on_install: true
```

Note! Install the Toit [extension](../vscode) for Visual Studio Code for better language support.

Find more Toit code examples [here](https://github.com/toitware/examples).

## 6. Deploy a Toit app

Deploying a Toit app on your device means that the Toit code in the `toit` file will be executed repeatedly according to the scheduling defined in `hello.yaml`.
In this case, when the app is installed on the device and if the device reboots.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Deploy the Toit app named `HelloApp` on your device with the following command. Replace `device-name` with the actual name of your device.

```shell
toit deploy -d device-name hello.yaml
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="VSCode">

Deploy the Toit app named `HelloApp` on your device with the Toit VSCode extension, by pressing the deploy button next to the device:

<img src={VSCode} alt="VSCode" width="100%" />

</Tab>
</Tabs>

When deploying an app, the device is not required to be online. The app will be installed on the device when it comes online.

### Verify that the app has been deployed

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Run the following command (replace `device-name` with the actual name of your device)

```shell
toit device -d device-name ps
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

Go to the Apps tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the list of deployed apps.

</Tab>
<Tab label="VSCode">

In the VSCode extension for Toit, view the name of the deployed app below the device name.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### View the logs from the device

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Run the following command (replace `device-name` with the actual name of your device)

```shell
toit device -d device-name logs -f 10m
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

Go to the Logs tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the logs from the device.

</Tab>
<Tab label="VSCode">

In the VSCode extension for Toit, view the logs from the device by pressing the logs button next to the device name.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 7. Uninstall Toit app

Uninstall the Toit app from the device:

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Run the following command (replace `device-name` with the actual name of your device)

```shell
toit device -d device-name uninstall HelloApp
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

Go to the Apps tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to uninstall the app using the uninstall button.

</Tab>
<Tab label="VSCode">

In the VSCode extension for Toit, uninstall the app from the device by pressing the bin icon next to the app name.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## 8. What's next?

Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing IoT projects using Toit. Next step, look in the [tutorials](../../platform/tutorials) or dive into the [Toit language guide](../../language/language).
