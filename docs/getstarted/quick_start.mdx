# Quick start

This guide will show you how to get a Toit account, install the Toit CLI locally, prepare your [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller with the Toit firmware,
and finally how to deploy a Toit app on your ESP32.

## 1. Sign up

Create a free Toit account to get access to the Toit cloud. Go to [toit.io](https://toit.io/#sign-up) and follow the sign-up instructions.

## 2. Install Toit

Next, install the Toit command-line interface (CLI), which is used to prepare your ESP32 with Toit and to deploy your Toit apps. Download [here](../download).

On **macOS** and **Linux**, put the Toit CLI manually to PATH. If you need help, follow the step by step instructions [here](../installation).

On **Windows**, the Toit CLI is automatically added to PATH by the installer.

## 3. Get an ESP32

You can buy an ESP32 [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990). If you already have one available, jump to step 4 to continue.

<Note title="Don't have an ESP32 yet?">

In the meantime, use the Toit [playground](https://console.toit.io/playground) or a simulated device to continue learning about the Toit platform.
Start a new Toit simulator from the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) by clicking the "Start simulator" button, or run the following command in the Toit CLI:

```shell
toit simulator start
```

Next, jump to step 5 to continue.

</Note>

## 4. Provision your ESP32

With your ESP32 ready for use, the first step is to initially provision your ESP32 with the Toit firmware and settings.

Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="CLI">

Replace `<SSID>` and `<password>` with your own WiFi credentials and run the Toit CLI command:

```txt
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid="<SSID>" -p wifi.password="<password>"
```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Console">

Go to the Serial menu in the web-based [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/serial) to initially provision your hardware.

A detailed description of using Web Serial can be found [here](../details/webserial).

Note that Web Serial only works in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

At the end of the provisioning process, you will receive the name of the device, and a URL to view the device in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/).

If there were errors, please consult the detailed descriptions in the [provision](../details/provision) page or get help in the [troubleshooting](../details/serialport) page.

When your device is visible in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/), all device communication will be via WiFi or cellular (if you have setup [cellular connection]()).

## 5. Deploy Toit app

You can either **run** a Toit program once on your ESP32 or **deploy** the same Toit program as a long-lived app.

First, save the following Toit code in a file named `hello.toit`

```
// Save as hello.toit
main:
  print "Hello, World!"
```

To deploy the Toit program as a long-lived app, save the following yaml content in a file named `hello.yaml` and place it in the same folder as the `hello.toit` file from above:

```yaml
# Save as hello.yaml
name: "HelloApp"
entrypoint: hello.toit
triggers:
  on_boot: true
  on_install: true
```

Deploying a Toit app on your device means that the Toit code in the `toit` file will be executed repeatedly according to the scheduling defined in `hello.yaml`.
In this case, when the app is installed on the device and if the device reboots.

Deploy the Toit app named `HelloApp` on your device with the command:

```shell
toit deploy -d <device-name> hello.yaml
```

When deploying an app, the device is not required to be online. The app will be installed on the device when it comes online.

Verify that the app has been deployed with the command:

```shell
toit device -d <device-name> ps
```

or go to the apps tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the list of deployed apps.

View the logs from the device with

```shell
toit device -d <device-name> logs -f 10m
```

or go to the Logs tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the logs from the device.

## 6. Uninstall Toit app

As the last step, uninstall the Toit app from the device with the command

```shell
toit device -d <device-name> uninstall HelloApp
```

or go to the Apps tab in the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to uninstall the app.

## 7. What's next?

Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing IoT apps with Toit.

As the next steps, have a look at the [Toit tutorials](../../platform/tutorials) with examples you can run
on your ESP32, or dive into the [Toit language guide](../../language/language), or view the list of
[available drivers](../../peripherals/drivers/driverslist).
