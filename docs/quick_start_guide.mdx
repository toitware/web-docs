# Quick Start Guide

This quick start guide takes you from signing up for a Toit account, get an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32" target="_blank">ESP32</a> microcontroller, and finally deploy a Toit app on your device.

## 1. Sign up

Create a free Toit account to get access to the Toit cloud. Go to <a href="https://toit.io/#sign-up" target="_blank">toit.io</a> and follow the sign-up instructions.

Shortly after, you'll receive a welcome email with a link to set the password for your Toit account.

## 2. Install Toit

Next, install the Toit CLI which is used for preparing your ESP32 with Toit, and to deploy Toit apps.

Download the version that matches your current operating system:

- <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/windows/installer" target="_blank">
    Windows
  </a>

- <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/darwin" target="_blank">
    macOS
  </a>

- <a href="https://archive.toit.io/cli/latest/linux" target="_blank">
    Linux
  </a>

On **macOS** and **Linux**, add the <Link to="../installation/toitcli">Toit CLI</Link> manually to PATH. On **Windows**, this is done automatically with the installer.

## 3. Get an ESP32

You can buy an ESP32 <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990" target="_blank">here</a>. If you already have one available, jump to step 4 to continue.

<Note title="Don't have an ESP32 yet?">

In the meantime, use the <a href="https://console.toit.io/playground" target="_blank">playground</a> or a simulated device to continue learning about the Toit platform. Start a new Toit simulator from the <a href="https://console.toit.io/" target="_blank">Toit console</a> by clicking the "Start simulator" button, or run the following command in the Toit CLI:

```shell
toit simulator start --alias MyToitDevice
```

Next, jump to step 5 to continue.

</Note>

## 4. Provision and claim

With your ESP32 ready for use, the first step is to <Link to="../connect/provision">initially provision</Link> your ESP32.

Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer where the Toit CLI is installed.

Replace `SSID` and `WiFi-password` with your own WiFi credentials, and run the Toit CLI command:

```shell
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid=<SSID> -p wifi.password=<WiFi-password>
```

Note the hardware ID printed when the command terminates.

Next, <Link to="../connect/claim">claim</Link> the ESP32 into your organization in the Toit console. Replace `<hardware-ID>` with the hardware ID from the provision command above,
and run:

```shell
toit device claim <hardware-ID> --name MyToitDevice
```

The claimed ESP32 can be seen in the list of devices with the CLI command:

```shell
toit devices
```

## 5. Get examples

Download Toit sample code and save it in a folder named `toit-examples` with the CLI command:

```shell
toit sdk examples toit-examples --version v1.0.2
```

## 6. Deploy Toit app

Deploying a Toit app on your device means that the Toit code will be executed repeatedly according to the scheduling defined in `hello.yaml`.

Deploy a Toit app on your device with the command:

```shell
toit deploy -d MyToitDevice toit-examples/examples_v1.0.2/hello/hello.yaml
```

When deploying an app, the device is not required to be online. The app will be installed on the device when it comes online.

Verify that the app has been deployed with the command:

```shell
toit device -d MyToitDevice ps
```

or go to the <a href="https://console.toit.io/" target="_blank">Apps tab</a> of your device to view the list of apps deployed.

See the logs from the device with

```shell
toit device -d MyToitDevice logs -f 10m
```

or go to the <a href="https://console.toit.io/" target="_blank">Logs tab</a> of your device to view the logs from the application deployed.
