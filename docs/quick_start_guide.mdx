# Quick Start Guide

This guide takes you from signing up for a Toit account, to install the Toit CLI locally and get an [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller, and finally how to deploy a Toit app on your ESP32 or a simulated device.

## 1. Sign up

Create a free Toit account to get access to the Toit cloud. Go to [toit.io](https://toit.io/#sign-up) and follow the sign-up instructions.

Shortly after, you'll receive a welcome email with a link to set the password for your Toit account.

## 2. Install Toit

Next, install the Toit CLI which is used for preparing your ESP32 with Toit, and to deploy Toit apps. Download [here](../download).

On **macOS** and **Linux**, put the Toit CLI manually to PATH. If you need help, follow the step by step instructions [here](../installation/toitcli).

On **Windows**, the Toit CLI is automatically put on PATH by the installer.

## 3. Get an ESP32

You can buy an ESP32 [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-DEVKITC-32D/9356990). If you already have one available, jump to step 4 to continue.

<Note title="Don't have an ESP32 yet?">

In the meantime, use the Toit [playground](https://console.toit.io/playground) or a simulated device to continue learning about the Toit platform. 
Start a new Toit simulator from the [Toit console](https://console.toit.io/) by clicking the "Start simulator" button, or run the following command in the Toit CLI:

```shell
toit simulator start --alias MyToitDevice
```

Next, jump to step 5 to continue.

</Note>

## 4. Provision your ESP32

With your ESP32 ready for use, the first step is to [initially provision](../connect/provision) your ESP32.

Connect the ESP32 with a USB cable to your computer where the Toit CLI is installed.

Replace `SSID` and `password` with your own WiFi credentials and run the Toit CLI command:

```txt
toit serial provision -p wifi.ssid=<SSID> -p wifi.password=<password>
```

At the end of the provisioning process, you will receive the name of the device, and a URL to view it in the Toit console. If there were errors, please consult the [provision](../connect/provision) or [troubleshooting](../connect/serialport) pages.

## 5. Deploy Toit app

You can either **run** a Toit program once on your ESP32 or **deploy** the same Toit program as a long-lived app.

First, save the following Toit code in a file named `hello.toit`

```
// Save as hello.toit
main:
  print "Hello, World!"
```

<Note title="Run program on a device">
  Run the Toit program once on your device with the CLI command

  ```shell
  toit run -d MyToitDevice hello.toit
  ```

</Note>

To deploy the Toit program as a long-lived app, save the following yaml content in a file named `hello.yaml` and place it next to the `hello.toit` from above:

```yaml
# Save as hello.yaml
name: "HelloApp"
entrypoint: hello.toit
triggers:
  on_boot: true
  on_install: true
```

Deploying a Toit app on your device means that the Toit code in the `toit` file will be executed repeatedly according to the scheduling defined in `hello.yaml`.
In this case, when the app is installed on the device and if the device reboots.

Deploy the Toit app named `HelloApp` on your device with the command:

```shell
toit deploy -d MyToitDevice hello.yaml
```

When deploying an app, the device is not required to be online. The app will be installed on the device when it comes online.

Verify that the app has been deployed with the command:

```shell
toit device -d MyToitDevice ps
```

or go to the [Apps tab](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the list of apps deployed.

View the logs from the device with

```shell
toit device -d MyToitDevice logs -f 10m
```

or go to the [Logs tab](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to view the logs from the application deployed.

## 6. Uninstall Toit app

As the last step, uninstall the Toit app from the device with the command

```shell
toit device -d MyToitDevice uninstall HelloApp
```

or go to the [Apps tab](https://console.toit.io/) of your device to uninstall the app.
