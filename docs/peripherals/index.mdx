# Peripherals

In this section you will learn how to work with [GPIO pins](gpio), and the various peripherals that the ESP32 supports,
and an example of how to [connect sensors](drivers/bme280) to the ESP32.

The ESP32 supports a [wide range of peripherals](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/index.html),
many of them supported directly by Toit, like the I<sup>2</sup>C protocol, the SPI communication interface, and GPIO pins.

## Selecting the right protocol

Many chips support both SPI and I<sup>2</sup>C. While Toit makes it easy to write drivers that are usable by both, there are some clear advantages and disadvantages between the two.

### I<sup>2</sup>C

- Supports longer distances
- Only requires two wires

### SPI

- Is significantly faster
- Frequency configurable per device, not the bus

## GPIO

With Toit, working with General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins is easy and they can be configured and manipulated at runtime.
In the [GPIO](gpio) section you'll learn how to use the GPIO pins with Toit.
